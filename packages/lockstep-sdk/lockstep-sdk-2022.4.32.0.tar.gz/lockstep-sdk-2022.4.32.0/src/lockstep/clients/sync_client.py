        Requests a new Sync task from the Application specified in the
        request and returns a token that can be used to check the
        progress and status of the task.

        A Sync task represents an action performed by an Application for
        a particular account. An Application can provide many different
        tasks as part of their capabilities. Sync tasks are executed in
        the background and will continue running after they are created.
        Use one of the creation APIs to request execution of a task. To
        check on the progress of the task, call GetSync or QuerySync.

        ----------
        body : SyncSubmitModel

        Updates an existing Sync with the information supplied to this
        PATCH call.

        This API is restricted to internal service users and may not be
        called by customers or partners.

        The PATCH method allows you to change specific values on the
        object while leaving other values alone. As input you should
        supply a list of field names and new values. For example, you
        can provide the field name "IsActive" and specify the new value
        "False"; this API will then change the value of IsActive to
        false.
