Whatâ€™s New:
===========

-  January 30, 2022 `Released OSLO 2.0 alpha
   version <https://github.com/tunib-ai/oslo/releases/tag/v2.0.0a0>`__.
-  December 30, 2021 `Add Deployment
   Launcher <https://github.com/tunib-ai/oslo/releases/tag/v1.0>`__.
-  December 21, 2021 `Released OSLO
   1.0 <https://github.com/tunib-ai/oslo/releases/tag/v1.0>`__.

What is OSLO about?
===================

OSLO is a framework that provides various GPU based optimization
technologies for large-scale modeling. 3D Parallelism and Kernel Fusion
which could be useful when training a large model like
`EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B <https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B>`__ are
the key features. OSLO makes these technologies easy-to-use by magical
compatibility with `Hugging Face
Transformers <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers>`__ that is
being considered as a de facto standard in 2021. Currently, the
architectures such as GPT2, GPTNeo, and GPTJ are supported, but we plan
to support more soon.

Installation
============

OSLO can be easily installed using the pip package manager. All the
dependencies such as `torch <https://pypi.org/project/torch/>`__ and
`transformers <https://pypi.org/project/transformers/>`__ should be installed
automatically with the following command. Be careful that the â€˜coreâ€™ is
in the PyPI project name.

.. code:: console

   pip install oslo-core

Basic Usage
====================

It only takes single line of code. Now feel free to train and infer a large transformer model. ðŸ˜Ž

.. code::

  import oslo

  model = oslo.initialize(model, "oslo-config.json")
