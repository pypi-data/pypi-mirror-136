UBC SiEPIC Ebeam PDK from [edx course](https://www.edx.org/course/silicon-photonics-design-fabrication-and-data-ana)

This is a gdsfactory-based pdk, which provides a fully scripted python based flow for the edx course.

## Documentation

- [UBCpdk docs](https://gdsfactory.github.io/ubc/) and [code](https://github.com/gdsfactory/ubc)
- [gdsfactory docs](https://gdsfactory.github.io/gdsfactory/)
- [miniforge install instructions](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge)


## Installation

### Installation for users


If you are on Windows, I recommend you install gdspy with Anaconda3, Miniconda3 or [mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge) (faster conda alternative) and `pip` for gdsfactory.


```
mamba install gdspy
pip install ubcpdk --upgrade
gf tool install
```

If you want to get all the extras (mode solvers, meep, circuit simulation ...)

```
mamba install gdspy
mamba install pymeep=*=mpi_mpich_*
pip install ubcpdk[full] --upgrade
gf tool install
```

Mamba is a faster alternative to conda, if you don't want to install mamba, you can also replace `mamba install gdspy` with `conda install -c conda-forge gdspy`

If you use linux or MacOs you can install directly from pip `pip install ubcpdk` specify a specific version `pip install ubcpdk==1.0.2`
and update to the latest version with `pip install ubcpdk --upgrade`

I also recommend you install the gdsfactory link to klayout `gf tool install`



### Installation for developers

For developers you need to `git clone` the GitHub repository, fork it, git add, git commit, git push and merge request your changes.

```
git clone https://github.com/gdsfactory/ubc.git
cd ubc
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt --upgrade
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
python install_tech.py
gf tool install
```
