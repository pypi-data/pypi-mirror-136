[![Upload pypi.org](https://github.com/kirin123kirin/cppgsh/actions/workflows/pypi.yml/badge.svg?branch=v0.1.5)](https://github.com/kirin123kirin/cppgsh/actions/workflows/pypi.yml)

# Overview
This Program Inspired by [Quom](https://github.com/Viatorus/quom#quom) I made.

# Goal
* Automation Build Single header for C++.

# Implementation
What is different from the original Quom?
* It is automatically looks for the root header or source 
and creates a single header in the proper order.

* Put the include file at the beginning to eliminate duplication.

# Install
```
$ pip install cppgsh
```

# UnInstall
```
$ pip uninstall cppgsh
```

# Requirement
* python3.6 later.

# Liscense

# Usage
```
usage: cppgsh [-h] [--include_guard format]

              [--linesep LINESEP] [--encoding ENCODING]
              input output

  --source_directory SOURCE_DIRECTORY, -S SOURCE_DIRECTORY
                        Set the source directories for source files. Use ./ or
                        .\ in front of a path to mark as relative to the
                        header file.
  --license_files LICENSE_FILES, -L LICENSE_FILES
