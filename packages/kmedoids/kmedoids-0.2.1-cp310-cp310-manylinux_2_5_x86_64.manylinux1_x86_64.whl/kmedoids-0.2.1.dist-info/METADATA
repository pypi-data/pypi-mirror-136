# k-Medoids Clustering in Python with FasterPAM

This python package implements k-medoids clustering with PAM.
It can be used with arbitrary dissimilarites, as it requires a dissimilarity matrix as input.

For further details on the implemented algorithm FasterPAM, see:

an earlier (slower, and now obsolete) version was published as:

This is a port of the original Java code from [ELKI](https://elki-project.github.io/) to Rust.
The [Rust version](https://github.com/kno10/rust-kmedoids) is then wrapped for use with Python.

If you use this code in scientific work, please cite above papers. Thank you.

## Documentation

Full python documentation is included, and available on
[python-kmedoids.readthedocs.io](https://python-kmedoids.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Example

```
import kmedoids
c = kmedoids.fasterpam(distmatrix, 5)
print("Loss is:", c.loss)
```

## Implemented Algorithms

* **FasterPAM** (Schubert and Rousseeuw, 2020, 2021)
* FastPAM1 (Schubert and Rousseeuw, 2019, 2021)
* PAM (Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1987) with BUILD and SWAP
* Alternating optimization (k-means-style algorithm)
* Silhouette index for evaluation (Rousseeuw, 1987)

Note that the k-means-like algorithm for k-medoids tends to find much worse solutions.

## FAQ: Why GPL and not Apache/MIT/BSD?

Because copyleft software like Linux is what built the open-source community.

Tit for tat: you get to use my code, I get to use your code.
