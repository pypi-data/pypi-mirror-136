# Python Potrace
Pure Python Port of Potrace. This is a python port of Peter Selinger's Potrace (based on 1.16 code).

This port is needed because many python hooks to the original code such as `pypotrace` have installation issues and compilation problems with some OSes. This potrace is written in pure python and will be compatible with basically anything.

# Installing

To install or use as a requirement:
* `pip install potracer`

### Potrace-CLI
If you wish to use the Command Line Interface that is stored in a sister project `potrace-cli` (https://github.com/tatarize/potrace-cli). This can be installed with:
* `pip install potracer[cli]`

or:

* `pip install potrace-cli`

The cli project contains valid console script entrypoints for potrace. If you install the command-line package it will add `potracer` to your console scripts. Note the -r suffix so that it does not interfere with potrace that may be otherwise installed.

# Requirements
* numpy: for bitmap structures.

# Speed
Being written in python this code may be about 500x slower than the pure-c potrace. It is however fast enough for general use.

# Parallel Projects
This project intentionally duplicates a considerable amount of the API of `pypotrace` such that this library can be used as a drop-in replacement.

This library offers CLI potrace as an optional package, to permit performing potrace commands from the commandline.
