# `edupage-api`
[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/ivanhrabcak/edupage-api/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/ivanhrabcak/edupage-api) 

This python library allows easy access to EduPage. This is not a Selenium web scraper. 
It makes requests directly to EduPage's endpoints and parses the HTML document.
