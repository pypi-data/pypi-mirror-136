Welcome to the Signalyzer Documentation
=======================================

|binder|

**signalyzer** is a Python package to analyze and process time-discrete,
equidistant measured signals, and visualize them with the open source `Plotly`_
library for Python.

Main features of the **signalyzer** package are

* transform and combine measured signals into a new one
* descriptive statistics over the measured signal
* interactive plotting of the measured signal with `Plotly`_
* integrating (accumulating) of the measured signal
* differentiating of the measured signal
* clipping of the measured signal
* slew-rate limiting of the measured signal
* filtering of the measured signal
* smoothing of the measured signal with statistics
* process measured signals with a moving window
* moving averages with window statistics
* moving differentiation
* moving OLS linear regression with window statistics
* shifting (moving) of the measured signal
* slicing of the measured signal
* evaluate statemachine transitions observed by measured state signal

.. important::

  The ``signalyzer`` package is best used within the `JupyterLab`_ web-based
  interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks or with Plotly
  `Dash`_ or Jupyter `voila`_ to build standalone web applications and dashboards.

Modules
-------

The ``signalyzer`` package comes with two modules.

The :ref:`trace module <signal trace>` for transforming, processing, analyzing
and plotting time-discrete, equidistant signals.

.. note::

  The ``signalyzer.trace`` module is imported into the package namespace.

The :ref:`statemachine module <statemachine>` for evaluating and plotting state
transitions of a state machine observed by a time-discrete, equidistant signal.

.. note::

  The ``signalyzer.statemachine`` module is imported into the package namespace.

Dependencies
------------

The Python package runs on `Python 3.9 <https://www.python.org>`_ or higher
and depends on the external packages:

* `numpy`_ for mathematical computations
* `scipy`_ for signal processing and signal statistics computations
* `pandas`_ for data import and statistic computations
* `plotly`_ for visualizations

You can get the latest version from the project `PyPI package registry`_.
