# doomsdaytutor

So you have the modest goal of comfortably saying:

> I know the weekday of birth of every person on earth, in our past and in the future, if just provided a date.

Learning the theory behind the [**doomsday algorithm**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2x3SSBVGJU) isn't hard, but practicing it becomes cumbersome. It requires mental energy thinking of dates and checking them afterwards. Wouldn't it be nice to have a program for that, one that **explains false answers**?

Doomsdaytutor will present you with questions and visually explain the algorithm if the submitted answer is wrong. If you are unfamiliar with the algorithm, doomsdaytutor will also happily explain it for you.
