Sending Emails
==============

This section covers the basics of sending emails.
See :ref:`configure` to revise how ``EmailSender``
is configured. At minimum, sending an email requires:

.. code-block:: python

    from email import EmailSender
    email = EmailSender(host='localhost', port=0)

    email.send(
        subject='email subject',
        sender="me@example.com",
        receivers=['you@example.com']
    )

.. note::

    If you don't spesify the ``sender``, the sender is considered to 
    be ``email.sender``. If ``email.sender`` is also missing, the sender
    is then set to be ``email.user_name``. Ensure that any of these is a 
    valid email address. 

.. note::

    Some email providers (such as Gmail) do not allow specifying
    sender. For example, Gmail will outright ignore it and always
    use your own email address.

Sending Email with Text Body
----------------------------

To send an email with plain text message:

.. code-block:: python

   email.send(
       subject='email subject',
       sender="me@example.com",
       receivers=['you@example.com'],
       text="Hi, this is an email."
   )

Sending Email with HTML Body
----------------------------

To send an email with html content:

.. code-block:: python

    email.send(
        subject='email subject',
        sender="me@example.com",
        receivers=['you@example.com'],
        html="""
            <h1>Hi,</h1>
            <p>this is an email.</p>
        """
    )


Sending Email with text and HTML Body
-------------------------------------

You can also include both to your email:

.. code-block:: python

    email.send(
        subject='email subject',
        sender="me@example.com",
        receivers=['you@example.com'],
        text="Hi, this is an email.",
        html="""
            <h1>Hi,</h1>
            <p>this is an email.</p>
        """
    )

.. _send-cc-bcc:

Sending Email with cc and bcc
-----------------------------

You can also include carbon copy (cc) and blind carbon copy (bcc)
to your emails:

.. code-block:: python

    email.send(
        subject='email subject',
        sender="me@example.com",
        receivers=['you@example.com'],
        cc=['also@example.com'],
        bcc=['outsider@example.com']
    )

.. _send-alias:

Sending Email with Alias
------------------------

You can also alias the sender and receivers:

.. code-block:: python

    email.send(
        subject='email subject',
        sender="The Sender <me@example.com>",
        receivers=['The Receiver <you@example.com>']
    )

Alias is an alternative text that is displayed instead of 
the actual email addresses. The receivers can still get 
the addresses though.

.. _send-multi:

Sending Multiple Emails
-----------------------

Normally Red Mail opens and closes the connection to the SMTP
server when sending each email. If you are sending large amount
of emails it may be beneficial to leave the connection open:

.. code-block:: python

    with email:
        email.send(
            subject='email subject',
            sender="me@example.com",
            receivers=['you@example.com']
        )

        email.send(
            subject='email subject',
            sender="me@example.com",
            receivers=['they@example.com']
        )
        ...

Alternatively, you may use the ``connect`` and ``close``
methods:

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        email.connect()
        email.send(
            subject='email subject',
            sender="me@example.com",
            receivers=['you@example.com']
        )
        email.send(
            subject='email subject',
            sender="me@example.com",
            receivers=['they@example.com']
        )
        ...
    finally:
        email.close()
