A crucial part of doing your work is making sure you have the software packages
you need. Coiled helps you manage software environments by building Docker
images from `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ and
`conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_ environment files for you. You can
then use these environments locally, remotely in a Dask cluster, and can share
them with your friends and colleagues.

The video below will walk you through the process of creating and managing
software environments.

Supported software specifications
---------------------------------

Coiled supports publicly accessible conda packages, pip packages, and/or Docker
images for creating software environments. You can also compose these steps by,
for example, conda installing packages into a custom Docker image.


Design
------

Coiled uses packaging conventions you're already familiar with. You can point
Coiled at a list of conda or pip pacakges:

.. code-block::

    import coiled

    coiled.create_software_environment(
        name="my-software-env",
        conda=["dask", "xarray=0.15.1", "numba"],
    )

or to a local conda ``environment.yml`` or pip ``requirements.txt`` file:

.. code-block::

    coiled.create_software_environment(
        name="my-software-env",
        conda="environment.yml",
    )

to have custom Docker images built and stored for later use. Note that you do
not need to have Docker installed for Coiled to build Docker images for you!


Usage
-----

Coiled software environments can be used both locally by :ref:`installing the
software environment on your machine <local-software>` and on remote Dask
clusters (e.g. running on AWS):

.. code-block::

    import coiled

    # Create a cluster that uses the custom "my-software-env" software environment
    cluster = coiled.Cluster(software="my-software-env")

You can also collaborate with your friends and colleagues by easily sharing
software environments.
