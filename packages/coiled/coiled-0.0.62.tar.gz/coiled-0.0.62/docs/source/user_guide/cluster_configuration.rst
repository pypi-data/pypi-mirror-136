Cluster configurations

.. currentmodule:: coiled


When creating Dask clusters, there are a variety of ways in which you can
customize the cluster. For example, you can specify the resources (i.e. CPU and
memory) available to the workers in your cluster, the software environment used
throughout the cluster, whether or not to make GPUs available, etc.

Each of these parameters can be specified when creating a ``coiled.Cluster``
(see the :ref:`cluster-creation` documentation for more details). Additionally,
it's also useful to be able to save these cluster options and share them with
friends and colleagues. Coiled uses the concept of a **cluster configuration**
to specify the parameters that define a Dask cluster, save them, and then share
them with others.

.. note::

    It's important to note that creating a cluster configuration doesn't create
    a cluster or provision any resources. You can think of a cluster
    configuration as a template, or recipe, for a cluster that will be create
    later.

The video below will walk you through the process of creating and managing
cluster configurations.

Creating cluster configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cluster configurations are created using the
:meth:`coiled.create_cluster_configuration` function. You must provide each
cluster configuration you create with a name to identify the configuration,
along with a set of optional hardware and software parameters.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    # Create a software environment named "my-conda-env"
    coiled.create_software_environment(
        name="my-conda-env",
        conda={
            "channels": ["conda-forge", "defaults"],
            "dependencies": ["dask", "xarray=0.15.1", "numba"],
        },
    )

    # Create a cluster configuration named "my-cluster-config"
    coiled.create_cluster_configuration(
        name="my-cluster-config",
        scheduler_cpu=2,
        scheduler_memory="8 GiB",
        worker_cpu=4,
        worker_memory="16 GiB",
        software="my-conda-env",
    )

creates a cluster configuration named "my-cluster-config" where the Dask
scheduler has 2 CPU / 8 GiB of memory, workers each have 4 CPUs / 16 GiB of
memory, and the "my-conda-env" software environment (also created in the above
code snippet) is used for the scheduler and all workers.

.. admonition:: Note
    :class: note

    Software environments used in Coiled clusters must have
    ``distributed >= 2.23.0`` installed as
    `Distributed <https://distributed.dask.org>`_ is required to launch Dask
    scheduler and worker processes.


Using cluster configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a cluster from a cluster configuration, use the name of configuration
for the ``configuration`` keyword argument to ``coiled.Cluster``. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    # Create a cluster configuration named "my-cluster-config"
    coiled.create_cluster_configuration(
        name="my-cluster-config",
        worker_cpu=4,
        worker_memory="16 GiB",
    )

    # Created a cluster based on the "my-cluster-config" configuration
    # It will use worker_cpu=4 and worker_memory="16 GiB"
    cluster = coiled.Cluster(configuration="my-cluster-config")

Note that you can also use *both* a cluster configuration and pass keyword
arguments directly to ``coiled.Cluster``. In this case, keywords which are
directly passed will take precedent over the values stored in the cluster
configuration.

For example, in the snippet below ``worker_cpu`` is specified in both a cluster
configuration and passed directly to ``coiled.Cluster``. So the value passed
directly to ``coiled.Cluster`` (i.e. ``worker_cpu=4``) will be used:

.. code-block::

    import coiled

    coiled.create_cluster_configuration(
        name="my-config",
        worker_cpu=2,
        worker_memory="16 GiB",
    )

    # Here worker_cpu=4 will be used
    cluster = coiled.Cluster(
        configuration="my-config",
        worker_cpu=4,
    )


Updating cluster configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can update an existing cluster configuration, for example to add a different
software environment, change the number of CPUs or memory, by calling
``coiled.create_cluster_configuration`` with the name of the cluster
configuration you want to update and the new specification for the cluster
configuration.

For example, let's update the memory of the cluster configuration that we have
previously created.

.. code-block:: python

    coiled.create_cluster_configuration(
        name="my-cluster-config",
        scheduler_cpu=2,
        scheduler_memory="8 GiB",
        worker_cpu=2,
        worker_memory="32 GiB",
        software="my-conda-env",
    )


Listing and deleting cluster configurations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to creating cluster configurations, you can also use the
:meth:`coiled.list_cluster_configurations` function to list all available
cluster configurations:

.. code-block:: python

    coiled.list_cluster_configurations()

There is also a ``account=`` keyword argument which lets you specify the account
which you want to list cluster configurations for.

Similarly, the :meth:`coiled.delete_cluster_configuration` function can be used
to delete individual configurations. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    coiled.delete_cluster_configuration(name="alice/my-cluster-config")

deletes the cluster configuration named "my-cluster-config" in the Coiled
account named "alice".


.. _cluster-config-visibility:

Visibility
^^^^^^^^^^

By default, cluster configurations can be viewed and used by any coiled user. If
you want a cluster configuration to be visible only to members of your account,
call :meth:`coiled.create_cluster_configuration` with ``private=True``

.. code-block:: python

   import coiled

   coiled.create_cluster_configuration(
       name="my-config",
       worker_cpu=2,
       worker_memory="16 GiB",
       private=True,
   )
