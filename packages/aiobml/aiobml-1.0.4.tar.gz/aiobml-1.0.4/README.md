This is an asynchronous wrapper around Bank of Maldives API. 

# How it works

Currently you can use this library to get the transaction history of all your Bank of Maldives accounts, details of all you BML accounts & contacts and add & remove contacts. 
If you want to check for new transactions; save the transactions to a db, check, alert and add any transactions that's not currently saved to the db *check the basic example below*.

This library is not fully completed yet. As of now it can be used to get the transactions done within the last 24 - 48 hours, get all the information about your Accounts and your contacts and add & remove contacts. *scroll to the end to see the to do list of this library*

# setup
You must have python 3 installed

### using PIP

```$ pip install -U aiobml```

### From Source

```$ git clone https://github.com/quillfires/aioBML.git```

```$ cd aioBML```

```$ python setup.py install```

# Basic Example

```python
import asyncio

from aiobml import asyncBML

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
bank = asyncBML(username="your_user_name",password="your_password")

async def start_bank_client():
    await bank.start()

@bank.event('new_transaction')
async def on_new_transaction(transaction):
    print(transaction)
    # on app reboot, event will trigger for all the transactions within 24 hours
    # Use a db to avoid being notified of the same transaction.
    # check if transaction is in your db
    # if not, save to db and alert about the transaction

async def contacts():
    data = await bank.get_contacts()
    print(data)
    # show all the contacts you have saved

async def accounts():
    data = await bank.get_accounts()
    print(data)
    # show all the accounts you have in Bank of Maldives

async def add_cont(account, name):
    added_acc = await bank.add_contact(account, name)
    print(added_acc)
    # adds the account your contact list
    # throws DuplicateContent error if it is already in the contact list

async def delete_cont(account):
    await bank.delete_contact(account)
    # deletes the first match from your contact list
    # account can be the account number or the saved name

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        loop.run_until_complete(start_bank_client())
    except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit):
        pass
    finally:
        loop.run_until_complete(bank.close())
```
