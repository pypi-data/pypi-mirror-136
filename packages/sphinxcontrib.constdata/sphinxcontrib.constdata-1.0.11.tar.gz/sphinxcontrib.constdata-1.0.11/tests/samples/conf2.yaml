- Variable: version
  Category: Project information
  Description: |-
    The major project version, used as the replacement for ``|version|``.  For
    example, for the Python documentation, this may be something like ``2.6``.
- Variable: release
  Category: Project information
  Description: |-
    The full project version, used as the replacement for ``|release|`` and
    e.g. in the HTML templates.  For example, for the Python documentation, this
    may be something like ``2.6.0rc1``.

    If you don't need the separation provided between ``version`` and
    ``release``, just set them both to the same value.
- Variable: extensions
  Category: General configuration
  Description: |-
    A list of strings that are module names of :doc:`extensions
    <extensions/index>`. These can be extensions coming with Sphinx (named
    ``sphinx.ext.*``) or custom ones.
    
    Note that you can extend :data:`sys.path` within the conf file if your
    extensions live in another directory -- but make sure you use absolute paths.
    If your extension path is relative to the :term:`configuration directory`,
    use :func:`os.path.abspath` like so::
    
        import sys, os
    
        sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('sphinxext'))
    
        extensions = ['extname']
    
    That way, you can load an extension called ``extname`` from the subdirectory
    ``sphinxext``.
    
    The configuration file itself can be an extension; for that, you only need
    to provide a :func:`setup` function in it.
