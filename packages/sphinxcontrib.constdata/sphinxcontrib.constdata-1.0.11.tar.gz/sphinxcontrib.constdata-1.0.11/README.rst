|project| is the extension for `Sphinx documentation <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ projects that allows showing values, listing tables, and generating links from CSV, JSON and YAML files. Instead of hard-coding values in the text, you write constants or queries replaced with value(s) from the external file(s). If the file contains language-sensitive strings, they can be translated with the rest of the Sphinx docs.

About
*****

|project| started from the urge to manage thousands of external strings like UI labels, keyboard shortcuts, etc., used in a large enterprise application's docs. Devs and translators often change these strings. Idea of hard-coding these strings in the docs, and manually watching changes and updating them across the docs, scared me so much that I developed this Sphinx extension.
