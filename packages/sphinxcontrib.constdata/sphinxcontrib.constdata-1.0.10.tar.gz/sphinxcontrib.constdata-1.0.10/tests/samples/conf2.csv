.. versionadded:: 3.5"
"version","Project information","The major project version, used as the replacement for ``|version|``.  For
example, for the Python documentation, this may be something like ``2.6``."
"release","Project information","The full project version, used as the replacement for ``|release|`` and
e.g. in the HTML templates.  For example, for the Python documentation, this
may be something like ``2.6.0rc1``.

If you don't need the separation provided between ``version`` and
``release``, just set them both to the same value."
"extensions","General configuration","A list of strings that are module names of extensions. These can be extensions coming with Sphinx (named
``sphinx.ext.*``) or custom ones.

Note that you can extend :data:`sys.path` within the conf file if your
extensions live in another directory -- but make sure you use absolute paths.
If your extension path is relative to the configuration directory,
use :func:`os.path.abspath` like so::

    import sys, os

    sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('sphinxext'))

    extensions = ['extname']

That way, you can load an extension called ``extname`` from the subdirectory
``sphinxext``.

The configuration file itself can be an extension; for that, you only need
to provide a :func:`setup` function in it."
