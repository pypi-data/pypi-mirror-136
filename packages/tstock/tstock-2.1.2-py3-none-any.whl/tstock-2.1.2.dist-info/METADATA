# Installation

### AUR

`tstock` is available on the AUR. If you are on an Archlinux system, you can just install it using your AUR helper. Example using `yay`:

yay -S tstock
```

### PyPI

`tstock` is also available as a Python package. You can install it using `pip`:

# Getting started

### AlphaVantage API setup

After installing `tstock`, you will need a AlphaVantage API key to pull the market data.

- Make a free AlphaVantage API account at https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key
- After creating the account, you will see your free API key
- Run `export ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY=<your access key>`. You can make this permanent by adding this line to your .bashrc

### Usage

```bash
tstock aapl # chart of $AAPL
tstock aapl -t 1min # the past 70 1-minute-intervals of $AAPL
tstock aapl -t 60min -b 24 # the past 24 60-minute-intervals (aka past day) of $AAPL
tstock aapl -t 60min -b 24 -y 20 # same as above, but only 20 lines high
tstock btc # chart of the cryptocurrency $BTC
tstock btc -w # same as above, with rocket ships ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
tstock btc -c GBP # same as above, but in currency GBP
tstock usd/eur # chart of the price of USD in euros
```

Run `tstock TICKER` to get the 70 day chart of `$TICKER`. Use `-b COUNT` to specify the number of days back you want to pull. `-t INTERVAL` will specify the time interval of each candlestick. Use `-y LINES` to specify the length of the chart's y axis.

To get cryptocurrencies, use the `-a crypto` option. For example, `tstock -a crypto BTC` would fetch a price chart of Bitcoin.

For more options, run `tstock -h`

You can get international markets by specifying a code after `.`. For example, to get SAIC Motor Corporation on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, run `tstock 600104.SHH`. Find more information on how to specify special tickers on AlphaVantage's docs: https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation

# Notes

- The free tier of the API is limited to 500 API calls per day, 5 calls per minute.
