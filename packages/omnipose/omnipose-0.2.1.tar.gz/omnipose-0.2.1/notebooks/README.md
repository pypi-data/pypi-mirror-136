# Omnipose
Script repository for [Omnipose: a high-precision, morphology-independent solution for bacterial cell segmentation](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.03.467199). Each jupyter notebook labelled `Figure*.ipynb` severs to generate the data and figures in our paper. Additional scripts are provided for training and running the segmentation algorithms we tested. Many algorithms required either a separate `conda` environment or a standalone application desfripbed below, so we opted to store our segmentation results for each algorithm in an appropriate directory to be read into the notebooks. These directories should be quite clear from thse scripts, but the top levels will need to be replaced according to your own folder structure. Namely, `/home/kcutler/DataDrive` on our Linux machine might be replaced by `/Volumes/omnipose_testing` on a macOS machine. Linux or Windows is recommended for Nvidia GPU support.
