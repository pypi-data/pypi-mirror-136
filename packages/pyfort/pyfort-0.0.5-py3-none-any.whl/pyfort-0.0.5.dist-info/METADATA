# fort

## About
Command line application created in python with json and sqlite to easy store password. The stored data will be encrypted so only the person with master key will be able to access it.<br>
The data will be stored at the execution location. So if you execute the program within USB drive path, the data will be stored in the drive. You can take your data anywhere with this.
- Note : The data will be stored at the execution path, so keep in mind where you execute/call program from.
