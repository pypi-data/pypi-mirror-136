# CORP Engine

## What is CORP Engine?
CORP Engine is a game engine/toolkit made in Python using the Pygame library.

### Why should I use it?
- It can really make your python game development experience more organized, faster, and better in general.
- It has **built-in parent-children system** with **game objects** and **services** to use. 
- It is very simple and efficient to work with compared to Pygame.
- Also, the entire engine code is in a **single file**, making it _really_ easy to set up.

### How can I set it up?
* Download the package using pip:

   `pip install corpengine1`

* Or you could use this repository as a template if you want to contribute to the engine.
