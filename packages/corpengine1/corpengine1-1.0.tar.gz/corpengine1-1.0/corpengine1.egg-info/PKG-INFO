        Benefits of using CORP Engine
        
        - It can really make your python game development experience more organized, faster, and better in general.
        - It has **built-in parent-children system** with **game objects** and **services** to use. 
        - It is very simple and efficient to work with compared to Pygame.
        - Also, the entire engine code is in a **single file**, making it _really_ easy to set up.
