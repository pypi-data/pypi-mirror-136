# PyRGFROSH

PyRGFROSH is a **Py**thon implementation of the **R**eal **G**as **FRO**zen **SH**ock 
equations[^1] solver, which calculates the conditions behind the incident and reflected 
shocks in a shock tube for an arbitrary mixture and equation of state. PyRGFROSH 
requires a thermodynamic interface for calculating mixture properties as a function of 
temperature and pressure and currently supports:

- [Cantera](https://github.com/cantera/cantera)
- [CoolProp](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp) (through the provided wrapper) 
- User-defined interfaces

The original RGFROSH was developed in FORTRAN at Stanford University by D. F. Davidson 
and R. K. Hanson using real gas subroutines for CHEMKIN[^2][^3].

## Documentation
