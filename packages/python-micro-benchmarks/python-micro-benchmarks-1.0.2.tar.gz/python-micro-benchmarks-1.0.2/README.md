## The project in a nutshell

Python-micro-benchmark is a library that aids in creating [micro to macro performance benchmarks](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-319-77525-8_111#:~:text=Definitions,operations%2C%20bandwidth%2C%20or%20latency.) for 
your code to find and visualize performance bottlenecks in your implementation in a flexible way.

With an emphasis on automation and visualizations, this library can integrate your benchmarks 
within a unit test framework allowing you to test your code early in the development life cycle 
and letting you render an assortment of visualizations to get the drop on a pesky performance 
problem in your code.

## Installation

Installation is easy using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) or clone the source code straight from GitHub.
```bash
pip install python-micro-benchmarks
```

## Getting Started

Getting started is straightforward after installing the package you can import the micro benchmarking object and 
**define a benchmark name** after that you can use the **run()** method to execute your benchmark on your creation 
and see if it is performing as expected.

Below you can find a simple example that work non-intrusively on your code (no changes needed):

```Python
from Benchmarking import micro_benchmark as mb
from tests.stubs import FancyCode as Fc

# Give your benchmark a name
mb.test_case_name = "quick_start"

# Define you benchmark
mb.run(
    method=Fc().fast_method,  # <-- Make sure you don't call the method
    arguments=[],
    iteration=100,
    pacing=0,
    processes=2
)

# Get a letter rank how your changes compare to a previous benchmark.
letter_rank = mb.regression.letter_rank  # > A+
```

To start up a benchmark or profiling session more flexibly you can also use the **trace** decorator called 
**"collect_measurements"**. To do this you simple decorator the function or method you wish to benchmark 
this can be done the following way:

```Python
from Benchmarking.profiling.intrusive import collect_measurements
from Benchmarking import micro_benchmark as mb


# decorate your function to be able to collect measurements.
@collect_measurements(test_case_name="decorated_function", enabled=True)
def slow_method():
    num = 6 ** 6 ** 6
    return len(str(num))


# Run your method.
slow_method()

# Interact with the micro benchmarking object to extract information.
print(mb.test_id)
print(mb.test_case_name)
print(mb.regression.letter_rank)

```

> get started.

## Visualize that pesky bottleneck

<!-- Visualization Animation -->

</p>

Visualization are an excellent way to find out why your code slowdown or isn't working the way you would expect.
python-micro-benchmarks offers out of the box the following visualizations, so you don't need to worry how to get 
your eyes on that pesky bottleneck:

- Flame Graphs
- Code Heat Maps
- Bar charts
- Scatter plots (Coming soon)
- Line Graphs (Coming soon)

Want to visualize the data yourself or share the data in a common format, no problem python-micro-benchmarks has 
you covered. You can export your benchmarks in the following formats through the benchmark API:

- CSV
- JSON (Coming soon)

> Check out the docs for more information how to visualize or export your measurements.

## Detecting regression between benchmarks

This project has the ability to detect an interesting performance regression using 
[statistical methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_distance) allowing 
that a code change can be ranked with a score from 0 to 100, or a letter 
[Japanese letter rank ranging from F to S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_Japan).

These ranking metrics allow users of this framework to quickly asses how much the performance of their code has
regressed after introducing a code change. In the below animation you can see the ranking metrics at work measuring 
the distance between two [CDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function) and ranking it 
using a letter rank:
