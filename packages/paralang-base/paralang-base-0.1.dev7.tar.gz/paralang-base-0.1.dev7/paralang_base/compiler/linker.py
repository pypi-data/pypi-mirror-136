This file is dedicated to the linker for the Compiler, which 'link' link
together FileCompilationContext instances in a parent
ProgramCompilationContext

.

The linker will validate the existence of all items, and generate the required
outgoing code, in separate files. The headers for all items will be also
dynamically created for the C-native inclusion. The linker in this case acts
like a linker, while the outgoing code are C headers and files.

    This is the Linker metadata instance, which will keep track of linker
    metadata inside a ProgramCompilationContext

    generation of the C source code.

    This will keep track of dependencies, requirements, type-defs and origins
    of certain variables. This will though not apply any logical analysis,
    except validating that the required types are matching with the types
    that are needed in this specific context (asserted by the previous logical
    analysis, which are then kept as meta data in the ParseTokens)
