    """
    Abstract class serving as the base for the error listeners in Para, which
    are used with Antlr4.

    Possible Antlr4 errors:

    - RecognitionException:
        The superclass of all exceptions thrown by an ANTLR-generated
        recognizer. Itâ€™s a subclass of RuntimeException to avoid the hassles
        of checked exceptions. This exception records where the recognizer
        (lexer or parser) was in the input, where it was in the ATN (internal
        graph data structure representing the grammar), the rule invocation
        stack, and what kind of problem occurred.
    - NoViableAltException:
        Indicates that the parser could not decide which of two or more paths
        to take by looking at the remaining input. This exception tracks the
        starting token of the offending input and also knows where the parser
        was in the various paths when the error occurred.
    - LexerNoViableAltException:
        The equivalent of NoViableAltException but for lexers only.
    - InputMismatchException:
        The current input Token does not match what the parser expected.
    - FailedPredicateException:
        A semantic predicate that evaluates to false during prediction renders
        the surrounding alternative nonviable. Prediction occurs when a rule
        is predicting which alternative to take. If all viable paths
        disappear, parser will throw NoViableAltException. This predicate
        gets thrown by the parser when a semantic predicate evaluates to
        false outside of prediction, during the normal parsing process of
        matching tokens and calling rules.
