# MooCoderPy
Python/Tkinter version of Moocoder

MooCoder is an IDE for programming MOO Code in LambdaMOO or similar servers. It incorporates a built in
MOO/MUSH client, supports the local edit option, and allows you to load and edit object verbs in different tabs.
It supports syntax highlighting, jump to error location and a stack trace window.

This should run on Python 3.6 (or better) and uses the tkinter with no external dependencies.

The original Delphi implementation can be found at https://github.com/rjmatthews62/MooCoder

## Installation ##
Can be installed via pip:
* pip install moocoderpy-rjmatthews62
* python -m MooCoderPy
## Setup ##
* **Setup -> Server Config** : set server address (and port) 
* **File -> Connect** - Connect to server
* **File -> Disconnect** - Disconnect from server
* **File -> Open** - Open a local file in the editor

### External Editor support: ###

If you set **@edit-option local+** on your MOO server, the **@edit** command will be redirected to MooCoderPy's internal editor.
Selecting **Edit->Send Update (or F5)** will issue the correct command to update whatever you are currently editing.
Each edited item will have its own tab, and you can use the test line as for the verbs.

**Project->New Tab (Ctrl+N)** - Loads a verb into its own tab. Press F5 to compile.

**Project->Get Verbs (Ctrl+Shift+V)** - Load all the verbs for an object into the verbs window.
    You can double click in the Verbs pane to edit that verb.

**Project->Clear Project** - Close all code windows and clear verb list

**View->Toggle View Ctrl+Shift+Y** - Toggle between terminal and previous edit view.

Basic error checking and stack trace implemented.

Syntax Highlighting implemented.

Command History is supported using the **up and down arrow keys**

Each code window has an optional single-line test command which will run on successful compile (F5)

Bracket Matching implemented

Right-Click in code window will bring up a context menu.
* **Goto Line Ctrl+G** will got to a line no in a code window.
* **Find Ctrl+F** - find text in current window
* **Find Again F3** - repeat last find
* **Replace Ctrl+H** - search and replace text
* **Refresh Ctrl+R** - Reload page from server
* **Redo Syntax** - redo syntax highlighting on page
* **Close** - Close current window.
* **Undo - Ctrl+Z** - undo last changes
* **Redo - Shift+Ctrl+Z** - redo last changes

A double-click on an error message or stack trace in either the stack or the main terminal window will go the the relevent source code.
