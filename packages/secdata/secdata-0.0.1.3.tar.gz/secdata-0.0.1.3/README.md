## About
A module to easily **Download Financial Data** reported to the Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC).

It deploys SEC's RESTful APIs, which delivers JSON-formatted data without requiring authentication or API keys.

Currently included in the APIs are the submissions history by filer and the XBRL data from financial statements (forms 10-Q, 10-K,8-K, 20-F, 40-F, 6-K, and their variants).

The JSON structures are updated throughout the day, in real time, as submissions are disseminated.

More info about the APIs can be found [here](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/sec-api-documentation)
