DenMune: A density-peak clustering algorithm
=============================================

DenMune a clustering algorithm that can find clusters of arbitrary size, shapes and densities in two-dimensions. Higher dimensions are first reduced to 2-D using the t-sne. The algorithm relies on a single parameter K (the number of nearest neighbors). The results show the superiority of the algorithm. Enjoy the simplicity but the power of DenMune.

How to run and test
--------------------

1. Launch Examples in Repo2Dpcker Binder

   Simply use our repo2docker offered by mybinder.org, which encapsulate the algorithm and all required data in one virtual machine instance. All jupter notebooks examples found in this repository will be also available to you in action to practice in this respo2docer. Thanks mybinder.org, you made it possible!

   [![Launch notebook examples in Binder](https://static.mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/egy1st/denmune-clustering-algorithm/HEAD)

2. Launch each Example in Kaggle workspace

   If you are a kaggler like me, then Kaggle, the best workspace where data scientist meet, should fit you to test the algorithm with great experince. (in progress ..........)

abstract = {Many clustering algorithms fail when clusters are of arbitrary shapes, of varying densities, or the data classes are unbalanced and close to each other, even in two dimensions. A novel clustering algorithm “DenMune” is presented to meet this challenge. It is based on identifying dense regions using mutual nearest neighborhoods of size K, where K is the only parameter required from the user, besides obeying the mutual nearest neighbor consistency principle. The algorithm is stable for a wide range of values of K. Moreover, it is able to automatically detect and remove noise from the clustering process as well as detecting the target clusters. It produces robust results on various low and high dimensional datasets relative to several known state of the art clustering algorithms.}
