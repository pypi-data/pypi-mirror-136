# FastAPI Returns Router

## Description

This Project is a simple layer that allows Returns to work within
FastAPI. It simply allows a person to return the base return's containers
from a route. It is a drop-in replacement for the normal FastAPI router.

It does require that the route functions have a typed return function.
