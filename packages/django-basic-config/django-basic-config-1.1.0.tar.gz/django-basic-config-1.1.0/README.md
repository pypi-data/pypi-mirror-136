<!-- TOC -->

This is a basic django app that creates a table for EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) configuration settings where each row has the following fields:

- application
- property_name
- property_value

It provides methods for retrieving configuration properties that allow for a default value to be passed in.  It is entirely in the admin and ORM layer, does not include an external-facing web app.  This is purposely not all that complicated or sophisticated.  If you want something more robust, there are other, better options.  This is quick and dirty.

# Installation

- This application, simple though it may be, has been updated to support django 1.7 and later, and with it the new built-in data migrations.
