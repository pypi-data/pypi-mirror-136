Description: Meta-tool that presents frames from a video to image analysis frameworks and uses the predictions to determine
        whether to use a frame or not.
        
        Frames can be presented as files (*file-polling-based*) with the predictions
        then being read from files that the image analysis framework generated.
        
        Alternatively, a Redis (https://redis.io/) backend can be used (*redis-based*),
        to broadcast the images as JPG bytes and then listening on another channel
        for the predictions to come through. This approach avoids wearing out disks.
        
        Rather than just processing every n-th frame, a simple pruning mechanism can
        be employed which discards frames that are too similar.

        0.0.9 (2022-01-27)
        ------------------
        
        - added support for pruning frames that do not exhibit enough change over the previous one
          (`--prune`, `--bw_threshold`, `--change_threshold`)
        
        
        0.0.8 (2021-11-02)
        ------------------
        
        - `process.py` and `process_redis.py` now allow iterating through images (.jpg, .png) in a directory

        0.0.7 (2021-09-27)
        ------------------
        
        - `process.py` now adheres to the `--output_metadata` flag
        - `process_redis.py` allows processing of frames via Redis backend
        
        
        0.0.6 (2021-08-05)
        ------------------
        
        - `frames processed` output is now always being output
        - added logging output for frame file and metadata file in `verbose` mode
        
        
        0.0.5 (2021-08-05)
        ------------------
        
        - added `--output_metadata` flag that stores information on predictions and cropping when outputting frames
        
        
        0.0.4 (2021-08-03)
        ------------------
        
        - added `--crop_to_content` flag that crops the frames to the bounding boxes
          (only when not generating an output video)
        - added `--crop_margin` option to enforce a buffer around cropped region
        - added `--crop_min_width` and `--crop_min_height` options to enforce a minimum width/height
        
        
        0.0.3 (2021-08-02)
        ------------------
        
        - added `--poll_interval` option (https://github.com/waikato-datamining/video-frame-selector/issues/2)
        - added logging output for when writing image to disk
        
        
        0.0.2 (2021-07-30)
        ------------------
        
        - fixed `return` statement in `process_image` method
        - added more debugging output
        - added `--analysis_keep_files` option for debugging purposes, which won't delete the output
          of the image analysis framework
        - added options for defining a frame window (`--from_frame`, `--to_frame`)
