        '''(experimental) Adds another job to the build workflow which is executed after the build job succeeded.

        Jobs are executed *only* if the build did NOT self mutate. If the build
        self-mutate, the branch will either be updated or the build will fail (in
        forks), so there is no point in executing the post-build job.

        :param id: The id of the new job.
        :param permissions: (experimental) You can modify the default permissions granted to the GITHUB_TOKEN, adding or removing access as required, so that you only allow the minimum required access. Use ``{ contents: READ }`` if your job only needs to clone code. This is intentionally a required field since it is required in order to allow workflows to run in GitHub repositories with restricted default access.
        :param runs_on: (experimental) The type of machine to run the job on. The machine can be either a GitHub-hosted runner or a self-hosted runner.
        :param steps: (experimental) A job contains a sequence of tasks called steps. Steps can run commands, run setup tasks, or run an action in your repository, a public repository, or an action published in a Docker registry. Not all steps run actions, but all actions run as a step. Each step runs in its own process in the runner environment and has access to the workspace and filesystem. Because steps run in their own process, changes to environment variables are not preserved between steps. GitHub provides built-in steps to set up and complete a job.
        :param concurrency: (experimental) Concurrency ensures that only a single job or workflow using the same concurrency group will run at a time. A concurrency group can be any string or expression. The expression can use any context except for the secrets context.
        :param container: (experimental) A container to run any steps in a job that don't already specify a container. If you have steps that use both script and container actions, the container actions will run as sibling containers on the same network with the same volume mounts.
        :param continue_on_error: (experimental) Prevents a workflow run from failing when a job fails. Set to true to allow a workflow run to pass when this job fails.
        :param defaults: (experimental) A map of default settings that will apply to all steps in the job. You can also set default settings for the entire workflow.
        :param env: (experimental) A map of environment variables that are available to all steps in the job. You can also set environment variables for the entire workflow or an individual step.
        :param environment: (experimental) The environment that the job references. All environment protection rules must pass before a job referencing the environment is sent to a runner.
        :param if_: (experimental) You can use the if conditional to prevent a job from running unless a condition is met. You can use any supported context and expression to create a conditional.
        :param name: (experimental) The name of the job displayed on GitHub.
        :param needs: (experimental) Identifies any jobs that must complete successfully before this job will run. It can be a string or array of strings. If a job fails, all jobs that need it are skipped unless the jobs use a conditional expression that causes the job to continue.
        :param outputs: (experimental) A map of outputs for a job. Job outputs are available to all downstream jobs that depend on this job.
        :param services: (experimental) Used to host service containers for a job in a workflow. Service containers are useful for creating databases or cache services like Redis. The runner automatically creates a Docker network and manages the life cycle of the service containers.
        :param strategy: (experimental) A strategy creates a build matrix for your jobs. You can define different variations to run each job in.
        :param timeout_minutes: (experimental) The maximum number of minutes to let a job run before GitHub automatically cancels it. Default: 360
        :param tools: (experimental) Tools required for this job. Traslates into ``actions/setup-xxx`` steps at the beginning of the job.
