Minimal Python client for the [Iris](https://github.com/dioptra-io/iris) API,
built on top of [Authlib](https://github.com/lepture/authlib) and [httpx](https://github.com/encode/httpx).

## Installation

```bash
pip install dioptra-iris-client
```

## Usage

```python
from iris_client import IrisClient, AsyncIrisClient

# NOTE: If the username and/or the password are not specified,
# they will be retrieved from the `IRIS_USERNAME` and `IRIS_PASSWORD` environment variables.

# Synchronous client
with IrisClient("user@example.org", "password") as client:
    measurements = client.get("/measurements/").json()

# Asynchronous client
async with AsyncIrisClient("user@example.org", "password") as client:
    measurements = (await client.get("/measurements/")).json()

# Helper function to fetch all the results from a paginated endpoint,
# available for both clients:
all_measurements = client.all("/measurements/")
```
