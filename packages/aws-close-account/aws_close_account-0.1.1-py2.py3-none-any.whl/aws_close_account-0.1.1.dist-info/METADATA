aws\_close\_account
===================

This is a simple Selenium script to close an AWS account via the web console.
It can also reset the account password, in case it is not known.

*Warning*: This script *does not* ask for further confirmation - it is expressly 
for those that want to skip all those manual steps. So please TAKE CARE and 
uninstall it once you don't need it anymore!

Why
---
I am creating individual AWS accounts for my students at HM (https://hm.edu)
Closing them at the end of term is boring and annoying, so I automated it.

Requirements
------------

This program requires an installed selenium driver to run.
It was tested using the selenium driver for firefox 0.30.0 
installed from https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases .


Usage
-----
The Browser window waits for you to input any captchas and possibly MFA Keys (not tested yet)

Quick Start::

  aws-close-account my-account@example.com
