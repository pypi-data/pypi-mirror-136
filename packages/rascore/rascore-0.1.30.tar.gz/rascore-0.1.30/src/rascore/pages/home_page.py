        ### Summary
        *rascore* is a tool for analyzing RAS structures 
        (KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS) by the conformations of their 
        catalytic switch 1 (SW1) and switch 2 (SW2) loops. 
        In addition, *rascore* can be used to build and query 
        an updatable database of all available RAS structures 
        from the Protein Data Bank with their SW1 and SW2 loops 
        conformationally classified and their molecular contents 
        annotated (e.g., mutation status, nucleotide state, bound 
        proteins, small molecule inhibitors, etc.). 

        Details of our RAS conformational classification are 
        provided on [BioArxiv](LINK) in the manuscript: **An expanded 
        classification of active, inactive and druggable RAS 
        conformations.** We hope that researchers will use 
        *rascore* to gain novel insights into RAS biology and 
        drug discovery.
