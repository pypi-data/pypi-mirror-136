# Mantra Mixer
Audio mixing library simplified. This library was made specifically for [Mantra AI](https://github.com/bossauh/mantra-ai) and still lacks a lot of features.

**What can you do with this?**

Well, you can play different audio files at the exact same time. It achieves this by creating tracks and each audio is being played at a separate thread.

## Requirements
- FFMpeg

## Usage
```py
import asyncio

from mantra_mixer import Mixer, Track


if __name__ == "__main__":
    async def main() -> None:
        # First let's create 4 tracks because we want to play 4 tracks at the same time
        # This creates 4 tracks with the name being the index but a string
        tracks = [Track(str(i)) for i in range(4)]

        # Now let's provide these tracks to the mixer
        mixer = Mixer(tracks)

        # Alternatively, the mixer can do this automatically for you by providing a int instead that tells the mixer how many tracks to generate.
        mixer = Mixer(4)

        # Optionally, we can provide a conversion_path folder to the Mixer class.
        # Sometimes a file format won't be supported, so we can get around this by converting it to a .wav file using ffpmeg.
        # The converted file is then put into the conversion_path folder.
        mixer = Mixer(tracks, conversion_path="./converted_files")

        # The following files will all be played at the same time
        await mixer.play_file("./file_1.mp3")
        await mixer.play_file("./file_2.mp3")
        await mixer.play_file("./different_format_file_3.m4a")
        await mixer.play_file("./different_format_file_4.flac")

        # These functions are non blocking functions. If you want them to block, pass a blocking=True
        await mixer.play_file("./blocking.mp3", blocking=True)
        print("This line won't be reached until blocking.mp3 is finished playing")

        # If you want the files to be loaded in memory you can do so by passing load_in_memory=True
        # You usually won't do this to avoid large memory usages, but sometimes you may want this because let's say after calling play_file, you wat to delete the file immediately or replace it.
        await mixer.play_file("./loaded_in_memory.mp3", load_in_memory=True)

    asyncio.run(main())
```
