    Initialize a OutputTrack.
    A track is what's responsible for opening a constant sd.OutputStream in the background.
    We can then play audio by putting ndarray data into this track's Queue.

    Notes
    -----
    - The shape of the ndarray must be the same as self.shape

    Parameters
    ----------
    `name` : str
        The name of this track.
    `callback` : Callable
        A user supplied function that takes in one argument, the provided value in the parameter is the ndarray's being played. If the track is paused, or there's nothing to play, the callback function is not being called (because there's no ndarray to supply it with). This callback then should return the same or modified ndarray (the returned ndarray is what ends up being played)
    `queue_size` : int
        The maximum number of frames to put in the queue. Defaults to 20. You normally don't have to touch this.
    `samplerate` : int
        The initial samplerate of this OutputTrack. Defaults to RATE. Note that samplerate will be changed once update_samplerate is called. Mentioned method is also always called when attempting to play files with a mismatched samplerate.
    `blocksize` : int
        Blocksize. This parameter is ignored if a InputTrack (see below) is provided. Defaults to None which is a calculated blocksize from the samplerate."
    `input_` : InputStream
        If a InputStream is provided here, the output of that InputStream will be automatically fed in this OutputStream.

    Audio Parameters
    ----------------
    `vol` : int
        The initial volume of the track. Defaults to 1 which is 100%. You can go higher than 1 but it starts to sound shit.

    `tracks` : Union[List[Union[OutputTrack, InputTrack]], int]
        Your list of OutputTrack (or InputTrack) or a `int` number of OutputTrack to pre-generate on init. If a integer is provided, that amount of tracks will be pre-generated and the name of each track is going to be `str(id)`. This class can only pre-generate a list of OutputTrack, if you want a InputTrack, you'd have to pass it yourself in this `tracks` paramater or append it to `self.tracks` after pre-generating a list of OutputTrack
    `conversion_path` : str
        Sometimes loading a file will fail due to it being an invalid format. To get around this, we convert it onto a .wav file, this is where those converted files are stored. Defaults to None which is to just allow loading of unsupported formats to fail.
    `tracks_params` : dict
        You'll use this if you provided an int to the tracks parameter. This is a dictionary that takes in parameters each OutputTrack object needs.

        Ex:
        if you want all generatred tracks to have parameters like these:
            OutputTrack(vol=0.5, callback=some_func)
