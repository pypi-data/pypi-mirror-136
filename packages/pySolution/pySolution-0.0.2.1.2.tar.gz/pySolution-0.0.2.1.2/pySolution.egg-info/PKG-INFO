Description: 
        A package that was created for the purpose of process modeling in different membranes. This is a solution chemistry toolkit
        that can compute details of "saline" solutions such as the activity coefficient of each ion (using the Pitzer model),
        osmotic coefficient, ionic strength, density of the solution, etc.
