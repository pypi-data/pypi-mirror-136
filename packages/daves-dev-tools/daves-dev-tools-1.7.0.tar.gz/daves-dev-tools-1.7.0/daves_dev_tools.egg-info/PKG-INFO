# daves-dev-tools

This project provides command line utilities for performing common python
development tasks.

## Installation

You can install daves-dev-tools with pip:

```shell
pip3 install daves-dev-tools
```

In order to use some features of this library, you will need to specify
one or more *extras*:

- "cerberus": This extra installs requirements needed in order to import
  `daves_dev_tools.cerberus`, which provides utilities for interacting
  with a [Cerberus](https://engineering.nike.com/cerberus/) vault.

  ```shell
  pip3 install daves-dev-tools[cerberus]
  ```

To install this project for development of *this library*,
clone this repository (replacing "~/Code", below, with the directory
under which you want your project to reside), then run `make`:

```shell script
cd ~/Code && \
git clone\
 https://github.com/enorganic/daves-dev-tools.git\
 daves-dev-tools && \
cd daves-dev-tools && \
make
```
  
## Usage

### Command Line Interface

#### daves-dev-tools clean

This command removes all files from your project directory which are ignored
by git, excepting IDE configuration files (".vscode" and ".idea") and
any explicitly excluded directories (see the CLI help text below).

```shell script
$ daves-dev-tools clean -h
usage: daves-dev-tools [-h] [--exclude EXCLUDE] [root]

positional arguments:
  root                  The root directory path for the project.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --exclude EXCLUDE, -e EXCLUDE
                        A path list of sub-directories to exclude (separated
                        by ":" or ";", depending on the operating system).

#### daves-dev-tools requirements update

Example:

```shell script
daves-dev-tools requirements update -aen all setup.cfg pyproject.toml tox.ini
```

The above command will update version specifiers for
all package requirements in your setup.cfg, pyproject.toml, and tox.ini files
to match currently installed versions of each distribution (matching existing
granularity, and only for *inclusive* specifiers—so where the comparator is
"~=", "==", ">=", or "<="—but not ">", "<", or "!=").
