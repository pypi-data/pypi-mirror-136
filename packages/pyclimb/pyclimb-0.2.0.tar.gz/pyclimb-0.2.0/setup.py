Different types of climbing (such as sport climbing, bouldering or ice climbing) each have their own grading systems, and many nationalities developed their own, distinctive grading systems.\n\n## Install\n\nThe recommended installation is via `pip`:\n\n```bash\npip install pyclimb\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```python\nimport pyclimb\n\n\npyclimb.convert(grade='6a+', grade_system='French', to='YDS')\n// '5.10b'\npyclimb.convert(grade='9c', grade_system='French', to='YDS')\n// '5.15d'\npyclimb.convert(grade='5.12a', grade_system='YDS', to='French')\n// '7a+'\n```\n\n## Note\n\nThis is a package under active development. Currently, only the following conversions are being supported:\n\n- [sport climbing] conversion between French grading system and the YDS ([Yosemite Decimal System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_Decimal_System)).\n\nOther conversions and different types of climbing will be included soon. These changes may drastically change the user-facing API, so do consult the semantic versioning of this package before upgrading to a newer version.\n\n## How to contribute\n\nIf you wish to contribute, [this](CONTRIBUTING.md) is a great place to start!\n\n## License\n\nDistributed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n",
