        ## Example
        
        Here is markata creating my personal site of several hundred pages in ~16s.

        I am still learning what this will be.  Code is completely in develop branch and likely to change significantly.
        
        ## Motivation
        
        I want a simple static site generator built off of plugins that are super easy to create, and intuitive to use.  I want to create content in markdown and not have to put much thought into seo meta tags or generating og images.  The final site should be lightweight, and not weighed down heavily with MB's of unused css/js.
        
        ‚ö° Fast enough site generation
        
        üîå Pluggable
        
        üß† Intuitive
        
        üêç Familiar language
        
        üñº OG:image out of the box
        
        üéØ SEO out of the box
        
        ## Using Markata
        
        The docs are still a work in progress, but the 
        `[base_cli](https://markata.dev/markata/plugins/base_cli/)` walks
        through how to effectively use the `markata build command`. At this
        point Markata is far from stable and **will change quite a bit**, should
        you choose to use it on  real site make sure you pin to the version that
        you want to build from.  I will let you know as it becomes more stable
        and ready to use without diligence of pinning to the version you want.
        
        
        **Honestly**  A big motivation for me was wanting to learn and understand how to create a project that is completely plugin driven.  This is highly a learning project for me, and it has grown into something I use each and every day.
        
        ## Development
        
        Currently everything is on the [develop](https://github.com/WaylonWalker/markata/tree/develop) branch.  As its still a heavy work in progress and likely to change significantly.
