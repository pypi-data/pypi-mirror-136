# `wavesynth`

A simple sound-synthesis library that provides a simplified stateful API
for generating music. The API is intentionally analogous to the `turtle`
API to assist in the creation of music-based assignments that duplicate
lessons from graphics-based assignments for more accessible course
design.

The library has fairly unsophisticated synthesis resulting in pretty
basic sounds, and is also not super performant, although both of these
things could be improved.

A log of notes is printed to assist with debugging and/or for matching
desired output.

## Dependencies

Writing audio to `.wav` files can be accomplished using just the built-in
Python modules, but if you want to play audio, the `simpleaudio` package
will be needed.


## Installing

To install from PyPI, run the following command on the command-line:

```sh
python -m pip install wavesynth
```

Once it's installed, you can run a built-in example using:

```sh
python -m wavesynth
```


## Documentation

See [the
documentation](https://cs.wellesley.edu/~pmwh/wavesynth/docs/wavesynth)
for more details on how to use it and what each function does.


## Changelog

- Version 2.0.0 replaces `stepUp` and `stepDown` with `climbUp` and
    `climbDown` and removes `leapUp` and `leapDown`. New functions like
    `setFundamental` and `setScaleType` manage an internal notion of key
    signature which controls how `climbUp` and `climbDown` change
    pitches. To emulate the old `leap` functionality, set the scale type
    to a pentatonic scale and use the `climb` functions.
- Version 2.1.0 changes volume handling so that `louder` can cause volume
    values to go above 1.0, but internally loudness does not increase
    beyond 1.0. This means that symmetric calls to `louder` and then
    `quieter` will always cancel each other out, even if the `louder`
    calls would take the volume above 1.0.
