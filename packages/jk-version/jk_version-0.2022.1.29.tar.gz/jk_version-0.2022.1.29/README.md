How to use this module
----------------------

### Import this module

Please include this module into your application using the following code:

```python
import jk_version
```

### Parse a version number

Version numbers can either be specified as lists of integers or as a string. Examples:

* `Version([ 1, 7, 51 ])`
* `Version(( 1, 7, 51 ))`
* `Version("1.7.51")`

### Version numbering schema

For compatibility reasons the version number parser is designed to accept the following schema:

*[ epoch ":" ] version_data*

Where *epoch* is optional and - if present - must be an integer, and *version_data* is a regular version string consisting of decimal numbers separated by full stops.

Examples for valid version numbers:

* `0`
* `0.1`
* `0.1.2`
* `2020.12.24`
* `2:0.1.2`

### Comparing version numbers

Version numbers can be compared. Example:

```python
v1 = Version("0.1.2")
v2 = Version("0.2.0")
print(v2 > v1)
```

This will print: `True`
