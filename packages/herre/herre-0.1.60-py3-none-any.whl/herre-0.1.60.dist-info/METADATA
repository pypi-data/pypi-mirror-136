# Herre

### Idea

Herre is the core library to provide the groundwork for every module of the arkitekt framework,


 
### Prerequisites

Herre only works with a running Oauth Instance (in your network or locally for debugging).

### Usage

In order to initialize the Client you need to connect it as a Valid Application with your Arnheim Instance

```python
client = Bergen(host="p-tnagerl-lab1",
    port=8000,
  client_id="APPLICATION_ID_FROM_ARNHEIM", 
  client_secret="APPLICATION_SECRET_FROM_ARNHEIM",
  name="karl",
)
```

In your following code you can simple query your data according to the Schema of the Datapoint

```python
from bergen.schema import Node

node = Node.objects.get(id=1)
print(node.name)

```

## Access Data from different Datapoints

The Arnheim Framework is able to provide data from different Data Endpoints through a commong GraphQL Interface
. This allows you to access data from various different storage formats like Elements and Omero and interact without
knowledge of their underlying api.

Each Datapoint provides a typesafe schema. Arnheim Elements provides you with an implemtation of that schema.

## Provide a Template for a Node

Documentation neccesary


### Testing and Documentation

So far Bergen does only provide limitedunit-tests and is in desperate need of documentation,
please beware that you are using an Alpha-Version
