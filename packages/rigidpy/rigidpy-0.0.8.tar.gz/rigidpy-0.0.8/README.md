***
`rigidPy` is a library written in python with minimal dependency to compute
rigidity properties of a graph/network. The namespace is designed to
resemble mathematical terminology unifying the research themes in mathematics, physics and biology. 
The library can be used to compute the rigidity matrix, vibrational properties, and 
elastic properties of the spring networks. It also offers a set of
tools to find different realizations of a graph for a given topology.

The library consists of three modules:

* **Framework**: This is the main module which given a set of coordinates and 
  connectivity can compute rigidty matrix, Hessian matrix, vibrarional frequencies, 
* **Conguration**: This module minimizes energy by optimizing the positions of sites 
  given a set of target edge lengths.
* **Circuit (experimental)**: This module allows one to start from a given framework 
  (identified by coordinates of sites and their connectivty) and find another network 
  that satisfies all constraints but with different position of sites (alternative 
  realization of a framework).

### Example

```python
import numpy as np
import rigidpy as rp
# position of sites
coordinates = np.array([[-1,0], [1,0], [0,1]])
# list of sites between sites
bonds = np.array([[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]])
# repetition of unit-cell
basis = [[0,0],[0,0]]
# which site is pinned in space
pins = [0]
# create a Framework object
F = rp.framework(coordinates, bonds, basis=basis, pins=pins)
# calculate the rigidity matrix
print ("rigidity matrix:\n",F.rigidityMatrix())
# calculate the eigenvalues of Hessian/dynamical matrix
eigvals, eigvecs = F.eigenSpace(eigvals=(0,3))
print("vibrational eigenvalues:\n",eigvals)
# visualize network (pinned sites are shown as red diamonds)
F.visulize()
```

Output:
```python
rigidity matrix:
 [[ 1.         -0.          0.          0.        ]
 [ 0.70710678 -0.70710678 -0.70710678  0.70710678]
 [ 0.          0.          0.70710678  0.70710678]]
vibrational eigenvalues:
 [2.22044605e-16 6.33974596e-01 1.00000000e+00 2.36602540e+00]
```
