# ![VoxelFuse](images/logo.png?raw=true)

VoxelFuse is a Python library for processing multi-material 3D model data. It includes the tools needed for a complete workflow from design to part fabrication, including part composition, manufacturing planning, design simulation, mesh generation, and file export. This library allows scripts to be quickly created for processing different classes of models and generating the files needed to produce them.  

Created as part of a research project with [IDEAlab](http://idealab.asu.edu) at [ASU](https://www.asu.edu/).

## Installation

The voxelfuse library can be installed using pip.

    pip3 install voxelfuse

[Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/) is used for mesh file import and Windows/Linux binaries are included with the library.

[VoxCad](https://www.creativemachineslab.com/voxcad.html) is used for running interactive simulations in a GUI. Windows/Linux binaries are included with the library.

A custom version of [Voxelyze](https://github.com/jonhiller/Voxelyze) is used for most simulation features. Windows/Linux binaries are included with the library. To use multiprocess simulation features on Windows, [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) must be configured.

[voxcraft-viz](https://github.com/voxcraft/voxcraft-viz) can be used to view simulation history files (must be installed separately).

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is used for some examples.

## Templates

Base template for creating scripts:

```python
# Import Library
import voxelfuse as vf

# Start Application
if __name__=='__main__':
    # Create Models
    model = vf.sphere(5)

    # Process Models
    modelResult = model.dilate(3, vf.Axes.XY)

    # Create and Export Mesh
    mesh = vf.Mesh.fromVoxelModel(modelResult)
    mesh.export('modelResult.stl')

    # Create Plot
    mesh.viewer(grids=True, name='mesh')
```

Template for creating scripts using VoxCad simulation:

```python
# Import Library
import voxelfuse as vf

# Start Application
if __name__=='__main__':
    # Create Models
    model = vf.sphere(5)

    # Process Models
    modelResult = model.dilate(3, vf.Axes.XY)
    modelResult = modelResult.translate((0, 0, 20))

    # Create simulation and launch
    simulation = vf.Simulation(modelResult)
    simulation.runSimVoxCad()
```

## Usage

See [cdbrauer.github.io/VoxelFuse](https://cdbrauer.github.io/VoxelFuse/) for library documentation.

See [cdbrauer.github.io/VoxelFuse/voxelfuse_examples](https://cdbrauer.github.io/VoxelFuse/voxelfuse_examples/)
for a list of the example scripts.

### .vox File Generation
If desired, input models can be created in a .vox file format to allow different materials to be specified in a single model.  This also speeds up import times compared to mesh files. My process using [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io) is as follows:

1. Use the "Open" button under the "Palette" section to open the [color-palette.png](../master/images/color-palette.png) file. This will give you a set of colors that correspond to the materials defined in materials.py
2. Create your model. By default, the library will use a scale of 1mm per voxel when importing/exporting, but this can be changed if necessary.
3. Save the model as a .vox file using the "export" function (NOT the "save" function).

Using MagicaVoxel and the .vox format will limit you to using distinct voxel materials. The library's import function will convert these files to a data format that allows material mixing.
