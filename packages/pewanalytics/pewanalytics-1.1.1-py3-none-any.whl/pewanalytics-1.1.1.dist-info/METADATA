# pewanalytics

`pewanalytics` is a Python package that provides text processing and statistics utilities for computational social science researchers.

## Installation 

To install, you can use `pip`:

    pip install git+https://github.com/pewresearch/pewanalytics#egg=pewanalytics

Or you can install from source:

    git clone https://github.com/pewresearch/pewanalytics.git
    cd pewanalytics
    python setup.py install

### Installation Troubleshooting
 
#### Using 64-bit Python

Some of our libraries require the use of 64-bit Python. If you encounter errors during installation that are related to missing libraries, you may be using 32-bit Python. We recommend that you uninstall this version and switch to a 64-bit version instead. On Windows, these will be marked with `x86-64`; you can find the latest 64-bit versions of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads).

#### Installing ssdeep

ssdeep is an optional dependency that can be used by the `get_hash` function in Pewtils. Installation instructions for various Linux distributions can be found in the library's [documentation](https://python-ssdeep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). The ssdeep Python library is not currently compatible with Windows. Installing ssdeep on Mac OS may involve a few additional steps, detailed below:

1. Install Homebrew
2. Install xcode
    ```
    xcode-select --install
    ```
3. Install system dependencies
    ```
    brew install pkg-config libffi libtool automake
    ln -s /usr/local/bin/glibtoolize /usr/local/bin/libtoolize
    ```
4. Install ssdeep with an additional flag to build the required libraries
	```
    BUILD_LIB=1 pip install ssdeep
    ```
5. If step 4 fails, you may need to redirect your system to the new libraries by setting the following flags:
    ```
    export LIBTOOL=`which glibtool`
    export LIBTOOLIZE=`which glibtoolize`
    ```
   Do this and try step 4 again.
6. Now you should be able to run the main installation process detailed above.
