- [sonar-projects-export](#sonar-projects-export): Exports all projects from a SonarQube instance (EE and higher)
- [sonar-projects-import](#sonar-projects-import): Imports a list of projects into a SonarQube instance (EE and higher)

:information_source: Although they are likely to work with many versions, the offered tools are **only tested against SonarQube LTS (Long Term Support, currently 8.9.x) and LATEST versions**

# Release notes
See: https://github.com/okorach/sonarqube-tools/releases

# Requirements and Installation
- `sonar-tools` requires python 3.6 or higher
- Installation is based on [pip](/https://pypi.org/project/pip/).
- Online installation.
  - Run: `python3 -m pip install sonar-tools`
- Offline installation: If you have no access to the internet on the install machine, you can:
  - Download the `.whl` file from https://pypi.org/project/sonar-tools or attached to the release at https://github.com/okorach/sonarqube-tools/releases. The file should be something like. **sonar_tools-\<VERSION\>-py3-none-any.whl**
  - Copy the downloaded file on the install machine
  - On the install machine, run `python3 -m pip install sonar_tools-<VERSION>-py3-none-any.whl`
  - Note: The package is dependent upon `pytz`, `argparse`, `datetime`, `requests` and `jprops` python packages. If they are not already installed, you would need to install those packages before installing `sonar-tools`

# Common command line parameters

All tools accept the following common parameters:
- `-h` : Displays a help and exits
- `-u` : URL of the SonarQube server. The default is environment variable `$SONAR_HOST_URL`
or `http://localhost:9000` if not env variable is not set
- `-t` : User token to invoke the SonarQube APIs, like `d04d671eaec0272b6c83c056ac363f9b78919b06`.
The default is environment variable `$SONAR_TOKEN`.
Using login/password is not possible.
The user corresponding to the token must have enough permissions to achieve the tool tasks
- `-v` : Logging verbosity level (`WARN`, `ÃŒNFO` or `DEBUG`). The default is `INFO`.
`ERROR` and above is always active.

# <a name="sonar-audit"></a>sonar-audit

Audits the SonarQube instance and output warning logs whenever a suspicious or incorrect setting/situation is found.
The detail of what is audited is listed at the bottom of this (long) page

Usage: `sonar-audit [-u <url>] [-t <token>] [--what [settings,projects,qg,qp,users,groups,portfolios,apps]] [-h]`

`--what` can be followed by a list of comma separated items
When `--what` is not specified, everything is audited

- `--what settings`: Audits global settings and general system data (system info in particular)
- `--what qp`: Audits quality profiles
- `--what qg`: Audits quality gates
- `--what projects`: Audits all projects. This can be a fairly long operation
- `--what users`: Audits users and their tokens
- `--what groups`: Audits groups
- `--what portfolios`: Audits portfolios
- `--what apps`: Audits applications

### Configuration file
`sonar-audit` can be configured with a configuration file to select what to audit and some different
other audit parameters.
You can create a default config file in the home directory by running `sonar-audit --config`

See [sonar-audit configuration](https://github.com/okorach/sonarqube-tools/blob/master/audit-settings.md) for the details of parameters


### Example
```
export SONAR_HOST_URL=https://sonar.acme-corp.com
export SONAR_TOKEN=15ee09df11fb9b8234b7a1f1ac5fce2e4e93d75d

# <a name="sonar-housekeeper"></a>sonar-housekeeper

Deletes all projects whose last analysis date (on any branch) is older than a given number of days.
Deletes user tokens older than a given number of days

Usage: `sonar-housekeeper [-u <url>] [-t <token>] [-P <days>] [-B <days>] [-R <days>] [-T <days>] [--mode delete] [-h]`

- `-P <days>`: Will search for projects not analyzed since more than `<days>` days.
To avoid deleting too recent projects it is denied to specify less than 90 days
- `-B <days>`: Will search for projects branches not analyzed since more than `<days>` days.
Branches marked as "keep when inactive" are excluded from housekeeping
- `-R <days>`: Will search for pull requests not analyzed since more than `<days>` days
- `-T <days>`: Will search for tokens created since more than `<days>` days
- `--mode delete`: If not specified, `sonar-housekeeper` will only perform a dry run and list projects
branches, pull requests and tokens that would be deleted.
If `--mode delete` is specified objects
 are actually deleted

### :information_source: Limitations
To avoid bad mistakes (mistakenly deleting too many projects), the tools will refuse to delete projects analyzed in the last 90 days.

### :warning: Database backup
**A database backup should always be taken before executing this script. There is no recovery.**

### Example
```
sonar-housekeeper -o 120 -u https://sonar.acme-corp.com -t 15ee09df11fb9b8234b7a1f1ac5fce2e4e93d75d
```

# <a name="sonar-loc"></a>sonar-loc

Exports all projects lines of code as they would be counted by the commercial licences.  
See `sonar-loc -h` for details

Basic Usage: `sonar-loc [-u <url>] [-t <token>] [-a] [-n] >locs.csv`  
- `-n`: Outputs the project name in addition to the project key
- `-a`: Output the last analysis date (all branches and PR taken into account) in addition to the LOCs


# <a name="sonar-measures-export"></a>sonar-measures-export

Exports one or all projects with all (or some selected) measures in a CSV file.  
The CSV is sent to standard output.  
Plenty of issue filters can be specified from the command line, type `sonar-measures-export -h` for details

Basic Usage: `sonar-measures-export [-u <url>] [-t <token>] -m _main [-b] [-r] [-p] [-f json|csv] [--includeURLs] [-o <outputFile>]`  
- `-m`: comma separated list of metrics to export
  - `-m _main` is a shortcut to list all main metrics. It's the recommended option  
  - `-m _all` is a shortcut to list all metrics, including the most obscure ones
- `-b`: Exports measures for all project branches (by default only export measures of the main branch)
- `-r`: Converts ratings as numbers (by default ratings are exported as letters between A and E)
- `-p`: Converts percentages as strings "xy.z%" (by default percentages are exported as floats between 0 and 1)
- `-f`: Choose export format between csv (default) and json
- `-o`: Define file for output (default stdout). File extension is used to deduct expected format (json if file.json, csv otherwise)
- `--includeURLs`: Add project or branch URL in measures export, default is to not include URLs

## Examples
```
export SONAR_HOST_URL=https://sonar.acme-corp.com
export SONAR_TOKEN=15ee09df11fb9b8234b7a1f1ac5fce2e4e93d75d

# Exports LoCs, nbr of bugs and number of vulnerabilities of all projects main branch
sonar-measures-export -m ncloc,bugs,vulnerabilities >measures.csv

# Exports main metrics of all projects and all their branches
sonar-measures-export -m _main -b -o measures.json

# Exports all metrics of projects myProjectKey1 and myOtherProjectKey main branch. Convert ratings to letters
sonar-measures-export -k myProjectKey1,myOtherProjectKey -m _all -r -o all_measures.csv
```

# <a name="sonar-findings-export"></a>sonar-findings-export
(Also available as `sonar-issues-export` for backward compatibility, but **deprecated**)

Exports a list of issues as CSV  or JSON. The export is sent to standard output or into a file
Plenty of issue filters can be specified from the command line, type `sonar-findings-export -h` for details.  
:warning: On large SonarQube instances with a lot of issues, it can be stressful for the instance (many API calls) and very long to export all issues. It's recommended to define filters that will only export a subset of all issues (see examples below).

## Limitations
`sonar-findings-export` does not export issues on branches (see [Issue #166](https://github.com/okorach/sonarqube-tools/issues/166))

## Examples
```
export SONAR_HOST_URL=https://sonar.acme-corp.com
export SONAR_TOKEN=15ee09df11fb9b8234b7a1f1ac5fce2e4e93d75d

# Exports all issues (main branch). This can be very long and stressful for SonarQube APIs
sonar-findings-export >all_issues.csv

# Exports all issues of project myProjectKey
sonar-findings-export -k myProjectKey -o project_issues.csv

# Exports all false positive and won't fix issues across all projects
sonar-findings-export -r FALSE-POSITIVE,WONTFIX -o fp_wf.json

# Exports all issues created in 2020
sonar-findings-export -a 2020-01-01 -b 2020-12-31 -o issues_created_in_2020.csv

# Exports all vulnerabilities and bugs
sonar-findings-export -types VULNERABILITY,BUG -f json >bugs_and_vulnerabilities.json
```

# <a name="sonar-issues-sync"></a>sonar-issues-sync

:warning: The `sonar-issue-sync` tool MUST be run with a specific service account (to be named on the command line) so that `sonar-issue-sync` can recognize past synchronizations and complement them if some updates happened on an issue that has already been synchronized before with the same service account.
`sonar-issues-sync --login <serviceAccount> -t <tokenOfThatServiceAccount> ...`

Synchronizes issues changelog between:
- All branches of a same project:
  `sonar-issue-sync -k <projectKey>`
- 2 branches of a same project:
  `sonar-issue-sync -k <projectKey> -b <sourceBranch> -B <targetBranch>`
- All branches with same name between 2 different projects of a same SonarQube instance:
  `sonar-issue-sync -k <sourceProjectKey> -K <targetProject>`
- 2 branches of 2 different projects of a same SonarQube instance:
  `sonar-issue-sync -k <sourceProjectKey> -b <sourceBranch> -K <targetProject> -B <targetBranch>`
- All branches with same name between 2 projects from different SonarQube instance:
  `sonar-issue-sync -k <sourceProjectKey> -u <sourceUrl> -t <sourceToken> -K <targetProjectKey> -U <targetUrl> -T <targetToken>`
  There is no requirements on the 2 SonarQube instances: They do not need to be of same edition, version or have the same list of plugins

Issues changelog synchronization includes:
- Change of issue type
- Change of issue severity
- Issue marked as Won't fix or False positive
- Issue re-opened
- Issue assignments
- Custom tags added to the issue

Issue comments are not (yet) synchronized

The source and target issues are synchronized ony when there is a 100% certainty that the issues are the same, and that the target issue currently has no changelog.

When a issue is synchronized, a special comment is added on the target issue with a link to the source one, for cross checking purposes. This comment can be disabled by using the `--nolink` option

All changes on an in issue that is synchronized, a special comment is added on the target issue the original login of the user that made the change, for information. Indeed all issues automatically synchronized are modified by the same service account. It's possible to disable these comments by using the `--nocomment` option

The tool sends to standard output a JSON file with, for each issue on the target branch or project:
- If the issue was synchonized
- If synchronized, the reference to the source issue
- If not synchronized, the reason for that. The reasons can be:
  - No match was found in the source branch/project
  - A match was found but the target issue already has a changelog
  - Multiple matches were found (list of all matches are given in the JSON)
  - A match was found but it is only approximate (ie not 100% certain match). The approximate match is provided in the JSON

## Examples
```
export SONAR_HOST_URL=https://sonar.acme-corp.com
export SONAR_TOKEN=15ee09df11fb9b8234b7a1f1ac5fce2e4e93d75d

# Syncs issues from branch develop to branch master of project myProjKey
sonar-issues-sync -k myProjKey -b develop -B master >sync_2_branches.json

# Syncs issues from projectKey1 main branch to projectKey2 main branch
sonar-issues-sync -k projectKey1 -K projectKey2 >sync_2_projects.json

# Syncs issues from projectKey1 main branch to projectKey2 main branch
sonar-issues-sync -k myPorjectKey -U https://anothersonar.acme-corp.com -t d04d671eaec0272b6c83c056ac363f9b78919b06 -K otherInstanceProjKey >sync_2_instances.json
```

## :information_source: Limitations
- The sync is not 100% deterministic. In some rare corner cases (typically less than 5%) it is not possible to determine that an issue is the same between 2 branches or 2 SQ instances,in which case the issue is not sync'ed. The script will log those cases
- When sync'ing an issue, all changes of the target issue are applied with the user whose token is provided to the script (it cannot be applied with the user of the original issue). Some comments are added to mention who was the original user that made the change
- To be modified (sync'ed from a source issue), the target issue must has zero manual changes ie it must be has created originally by SonarQube
- `sonar-issues-sync` can't sync all branches of 2 different projects (of a same instance or different instances). See [Issue #162](https://github.com/okorach/sonarqube-tools/issues/162)

# <a name="sonar-projects-export"></a>sonar-projects-export

Exports all projects of a given SonarQube instance.  
:warning: This requires a SonarQube Enterprise or Data Center Edition.  
It sends to the output a CSV with the list of project keys, the export result (`SUCCESS` or `FAIL`), and:
- If the export was successful, the generated zip file
- If the export was failed, the failure reason

:information_source: All zip files are generated in the SonarQube instance standard location (under `data/governance/project_dumps/export`). On a DCE, the export may be distributed over all the Application Nodes

The CSV file generated is to be used by the `sonar-projects-import` tool

## Examples
```
export SONAR_HOST_URL=https://sonar.acme-corp.com
export SONAR_TOKEN=15ee09df11fb9b8234b7a1f1ac5fce2e4e93d75d
sonar-projects-export >exported_projects.csv
```

# <a name="sonar-projects-import"></a>sonar-projects-import

Imports a list of projects previously exported with `sonar-projects-export`.  
:warning: This requires a SonarQube Enterprise or Data Center Edition.  
It takes as input a CSV file produced by `sonar-projects-export`

:information_source: All exported zip files must be first copied to the right location on the target SonarQube instance for the import to be successful (In `data/governance/project_dumps/import`)

## Examples
```
export SONAR_HOST_URL=https://sonar.acme-corp.com
export SONAR_TOKEN=15ee09df11fb9b8234b7a1f1ac5fce2e4e93d75d

# Import all projects with the CSV information file generated by "sonar-projects-export"
sonar-projects-import -f exported_projects.csv
```

# Tools coming soon

## sonar-issues-recover

Tries to recover issues that were mistakenly closed following a scan with incorrect parameters. This tool is only useful for SonarQube instances in version 7.9.x and lower since this feature is built-in with SonarQube 8.x and higher

Issue recovery means:
- Reapplying all transitions to the issue to reach its final state before close (Usually *False positive* or *Won't Fix*)
- Reapplying all manual comments
- Reapplying all severity or issue type change

### :information_source: Limitations
- The script has to be run before the closed issue purge period (SonarQube parameter `sonar.dbcleaner.daysBeforeDeletingClosedIssues` whose default value is **30 days**)
- The recovery is not 100% deterministic. In some rare corner cases (typically less than 5%) it is not possible to determine that an issue was closed unexpectedly, in which case the issue is not recovered. The script will log those cases
- When recovering an issue all state change of the issue are applied with the user whose token is provided to the script (it cannot be applied with the original user). Some comments are added to mention who was the original user that made the change

### Examples
```
issues_recover.py -u <url> -t <token> -k <projectKey>
```

## sonar-project-history
Extracts the history of some given metrics for a given project
