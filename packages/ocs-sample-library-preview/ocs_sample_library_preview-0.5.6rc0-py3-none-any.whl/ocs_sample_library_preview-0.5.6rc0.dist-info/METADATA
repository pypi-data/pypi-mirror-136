# OSIsoft Cloud Services Python Library Sample

**Version:** 0.5.6_preview

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/osieng/engineering/_apis/build/status/product-readiness/OCS/osisoft.sample-ocs-sample_libraries-python?branchName=main)](https://dev.azure.com/osieng/engineering/_build/latest?definitionId=2622&branchName=main)

This sample library requires Python 3.7+. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- __NOTE__: The library previously required Python 3.9+ to take advantage of type annotations. To provide compatibility with environments that cannot upgrade Python to 3.9, `from __future__ import annotations` was added to each necessary file. [This provides backwards compatibility down to Python 3.7](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__future__.html).

## About the library

The python OCS library is an introductory language-specific examples of programming against OSISoft Cloud Services ([OCS](https://www.osisoft.com/Solutions/OSIsoft-Cloud-Services/)). It is as instructional samples only and are not for production use.

They can be obtained by running: `pip install ocs_sample_library_preview`

The library is not intended to show every endpoint and every option/parameter for endpoints it has. The library is known to be incomplete.

Other language libraries and samples are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/osisoft/OSI-Samples).

Tests are done by testing the sample apps that use this.
