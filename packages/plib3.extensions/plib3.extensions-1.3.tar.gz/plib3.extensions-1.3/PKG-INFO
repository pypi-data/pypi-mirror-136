plib3.extensions
================

The PLIB3.EXTENSIONS package contains functions (and possibly,
in the future, other objects) exported from an extension
module written using the Python/C API. The general
philosophy of PLIB3 is to do everything possible in pure
Python, so the only functions that appear in this package
are those which by their very nature cannot be done in pure
Python. The latest official release is available on PyPI at
https://pypi.org/project/plib3.extensions/
and the latest source code is available on Gitlab at
https://gitlab.com/pdonis/plib3-extensions.

PLIB3.EXTENSIONS is built using the ``build`` PEP 517 build tool
with ``setuptools`` in "legacy" mode, using ``setup.py`` instead
of ``setup.cfg``, since building extension modules is currently
not supported in ``setup.cfg``. It uses the ``setuputils`` helper
module to populate the setup variables in ``setup.py``, and to
build the ``MANIFEST.in`` file that is used in the distribution.
This module is available at https://gitlab.com/pdonis/setuputils3.

The PLIB3.EXTENSIONS Package
----------------------------

The following functions are available in the ``plib.extensions``
namespace:

- The ``capsule_compare`` function checks whether two Capsules
  wrap the same C-level pointer.

Installation
------------

The simplest way to install PLIB3.EXTENSIONS is by using ``pip``:

    $ python3 -m pip install plib3.extensions

This will download the latest release from PyPI and install it
on your system. If you already have a downloaded source tarball,
you can have ``pip`` install it directly by giving its
filename in place of "plib3.extensions" in the above command line.

The Zen of PLIB3
----------------

There is no single unifying purpose or theme to PLIB3, but
like Python itself, it does have a 'Zen' of sorts:

- Express everything possible in terms of built-in Python
  data structures.

- Once you've expressed it that way, what the code is
  going to do with it should be obvious.

- Avoid boilerplate code, *and* boilerplate data. Every
  piece of data your program needs should have one and
  only one source.
