There were also some bugs that bothered me with the project when I tried to get it up and running.\nFeatures missing\n\nThere are a number of features that I wanted, but were not available.\n\n* Thresholds allow temperature range before changing fan speed\n* Frequency setting to allow better control\n* Monitoring to be able to see real-time fan speeds and temperature\n\n### Security Fixes\n\nThere are some un-addressed pull requests for some recent YAML vulnerabilities that are still present in the old amdgpu_fan project, that I’ve addressed in this fork.\n\n### Basic functionality\n\nSetting the card to system managed using the amdgpu_fan pegs your GPU fan at 100%, instead of allowing the system to manage the fan settings. I fixed that bug as well in this release.\n\nThese are all addressed in Amdfan, and as long as I’ve still got some AMD cards I intend to at least maintain this for myself. And anyone’s able to help out since this is open source. I would have liked to just contribute these fixes to the main project, but it’s now inactive.\n\n# Documentation\n## Usage\n\n``` bash\nUsage: amdfan.py [OPTIONS]\n\nOptions:\n  --daemon         Run as daemon applying the fan curve\n  --monitor        Run as a monitor showing temp and fan speed\n  --manual         Manually set the fan speed value of a card\n  --configuration  Prints out the default configuration for you to use\n  --service        Prints out the amdfan.service file to use with systemd\n  --help           Show this message and exit.\n```\n\n## Daemon\n\nAmdfan is also runnable as a systemd service, with the provided ```amdfan.service```.\n\n## Monitor\n\nYou can use Amdfan to monitor your AMD video cards using the ```--monitor``` flag.\n\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcgillij/amdfan/main/images/screenshot.png)\n\n## Manual\n\nAlternatively if you don\'t want to set a fan curve, you can just apply a fan setting manually. \nAlso allows you to revert the fan control to the systems default behavior by using the "auto" parameter.\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcgillij/amdfan/main/images/manual.png)\n\n## Configuration\n\nThis will dump out the default configuration that would get generated for `/etc/amdfan.yml` when you first run it as a service. This allows you to configure the settings prior to running it as a daemon if you wish.\n\nRunning `amdfan --configuration` will output the following block to STDOUT.\n\n``` bash\n#Fan Control Matrix.\n# [<Temp in C>,<Fanspeed in %>]\nspeed_matrix:\n- [4, 4]\n- [30, 33]\n- [45, 50]\n- [60, 66]\n- [65, 69]\n- [70, 75]\n- [75, 89]\n- [80, 100]\n\n# Current Min supported value is 4 due to driver bug\n#\n# Optional configuration options\n#\n# Allows for some leeway +/- temp, as to not constantly change fan speed\n# threshold: 4\n#\n# Frequency will change how often we probe for the temp\n# frequency: 5\n#\n# While frequency and threshold are optional, I highly recommend finding\n# settings that work for you. I\'ve included the defaults I use above.\n#\n# cards:\n# can be any card returned from `ls /sys/class/drm | grep "^card[[:digit:]]$"`\n# - card0\n```\nYou can use this to generate your configuration by doing ``amdfan --configuration > amdfan.yml``, you can then modify the settings and place it in ``/etc/amdfan.yml`` for when you would like to run it as a service.\n\n## Service\n\nThis is just a convenience method for dumping out the `amdfan.service` that would get installed if you used a package manager to install amdfan. Useful if you installed the module via `pip`, `pipenv` or `poetry`.\n\nRunning `amdfan --service` will output the following block to STDOUT.\n\n``` bash\n[Unit]\nDescription=amdfan controller\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/usr/bin/amdfan --daemon\nRestart=always\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\n# Note\n\nMonitoring fan speeds and temperatures can run with regular user permissions.\n`root` permissions are required for changing the settings / running as a daemon.\n\n# Recommended settings\n\nBelow is the settings that I use on my machines to control the fan curve without too much fuss, but you should find a frequency and threshold setting that works for your workloads.\n\n`/etc/amdfan.yml`\n``` bash\nspeed_matrix:\n- [4, 4]\n- [30, 33]\n- [45, 50]\n- [60, 66]\n- [65, 69]\n- [70, 75]\n- [75, 89]\n- [80, 100]\n\nthreshold: 4\nfrequency: 5\n```\n\n## Installing the systemd service\nIf you installed via the AUR, the service is already installed, and you just need to *start/enable* it. If you installed via pip/pipenv or poetry, you can generate your systemd service file with the following command.\n\n``` bash\namdfan --service > amdfan.service && sudo mv amdfan.service /usr/lib/systemd/system/\n```\n\n## Starting the systemd service\n\nTo run the service, you can run the following commands to **start/enable** the service.\n\n``` bash\nsudo systemctl start amdfan\nsudo systemctl enable amdfan\n```\n\nAfter you\'ve started it, you may want to edit the settings found in `/etc/amdfan.yml`. Once your happy with those, you can restart amdfan with the following command.\n\n``` bash\nsudo systemctl restart amdfan\n```\n\n## Checking the status\nYou can check the systemd service status with the following command:\n\n``` bash\nsystemctl status amdfan\n```\n\n\n## Building Arch AUR package\n\nBuilding the Arch package assumes you already have a chroot env setup to build packages.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://aur.archlinux.org/amdfan.git\ncd amdfan/\nmakechrootpkg -c -r $HOME/$CHROOT\n```\n\n## Installing the Arch package\n\n``` bash\nsudo pacman -U --asdeps amdfan-*-any.pkg.tar.zst\n```\n\n# Installing from PyPi\nYou can also install amdfan from pypi using something like poetry.\n\n``` bash\npoetry init\npoetry add amdfan\npoetry run amdfan --help\n```\n\n# Building Python package\nRequires [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to be installed\n\n``` bash\ngit clone git@github.com:mcgillij/amdfan.git\ncd amdfan/\npoetry build\n```\n',
