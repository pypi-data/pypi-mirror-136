A base library for the Science Archive and Ingester library to support generalized input file types, generalized data stores, and shared configuration items. This library is configurable via environment variables, but more customization is possible by subclassing the `DataFile` class for a specific file type, or subclassing the `FileStore` class for a specific file storage scheme.

## Prerequisites

Optional prerequisites may be skipped for reduced functionality.

-   Python >= 3.6

## Installation

It is highly recommended that you install and run your python code inside a dedicated python
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

Add the `ocs_archive` package to your python environment:

```bash
(venv) $ pip install ocs_archive
```

### Input File Format Configuration

The library is designed to be configured mostly through environment variables, but custom `DataFile` subclasses can be included and specified via an environment variable in order to support new and more complicated data formats. All data files must contain the minimum set of metadata in order to ingested into the archive. This metadata is used to provide filtering and querying support within the archive. The pieces of file metadata that should be specified have their mappings defined in the Header Data section of the environment variables below. The `FitsFile` class provided will work for normal or funpacked fits files, provided you set up the Header Data environment variables with the correct mapping of observation concepts to header keys in your data format.

### File Storage Format Configuration

The library supports three types of file storage by default, that can be selected via environment variable. The `dummy` type is just used for testing and development and doesn't actually store any file. The `local` storage just saves the files into a locally mounted directory. It requires you to run a separate file server on that directory so it knows how to direct links to download the files. This can be accomplished as simply as running `python -m http.server --directory=/my/root/dir`. It could alternatively be served using any other file server, like node's http-server. The third option is `s3`, and expects to connect to Amazon's S3 or something with that same interface like minio. S3 file storage requires `BUCKET`, `AWS_*`, and `S3_*` environment variables to be set. More storage types can be added via forking the library and subclassing the `FileStore` class.
