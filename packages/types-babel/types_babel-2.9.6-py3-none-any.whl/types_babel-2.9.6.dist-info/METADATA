## Typing stubs for babel

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `babel` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `babel`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/babel. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `67766f282fd21a048cb7ee2d8ea5558196a3af03`.
