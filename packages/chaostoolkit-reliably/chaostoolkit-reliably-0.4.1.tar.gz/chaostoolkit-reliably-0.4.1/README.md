# Chaos Toolkit extension for Reliably

![Build](https://github.com/chaostoolkit-incubator/chaostoolkit-reliably/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

[Reliably][reliably] support for the [Chaos Toolkit][chaostoolkit].

[reliably]: https://reliably.com
[chaostoolkit]: http://chaostoolkit.org/

## Install

To be used from your experiment, this package must be installed in the Python
environment where [chaostoolkit][] already lives.

[chaostoolkit]: https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit

```
$ pip install chaostoolkit-reliably
```

## Authentication

To use this package, you must create have registered with Reliably services
through their [CLI][configreliably].

[configreliably]: https://reliably.com/docs/getting-started/login/

You have two ways to pass on the credentials information.

The first one by specifying the path to the Reliably's configuration file,
which defaults to `$HOME/.config/reliably/config.yaml`. The simplest way to
achieve this is by running `$ reliably login` as this will generate the
appropriate file.

```json
{
    "configuration": {
        "reliably_config_path": "~/.config/reliably/config.yaml"
    }
}
```

Because we use the default path, you may omit this configuration's entry
altogether unless you need a specific different path.

The second one is by setting some environment variables as secrets. This is
for specific use case and usually not required.

* `RELIABLY_TOKEN`: the token to authenticate against Reliably's API
* `RELIABLY_ORG`: the Reliably organisation to use
* `RELIABLY_HOST:`: the hostname to connect to, default to `reliably.com`

```json
{
    "secrets": {
        "reliably": {
            "token": {
                "type": "env",
                "key": "RELIABLY_TOKEN"
            },
            "org": {
                "type": "env",
                "key": "RELIABLY_ORG"
            },
            "host": {
                "type": "env",
                "key": "RELIABLY_HOST",
                "default": "reliably.com"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Usage

### As Steady Steate Hypothesis

You can use Reliably's SLO as a mechanism to determine if your system has
deviated during a Chaos Toolkit experiment. Here is a simple example:

```json
"steady-state-hypothesis": {
    "title": "We do not consume all of our error budgets during the experiment",
    "probes": [
        {
            "name": "Our 'Must be good' SLO results must be OK",
            "type": "probe",
            "provider": {
                "type": "python",
                "module": "chaosreliably.slo.probes",
                "func": "slo_is_met",
                "arguments": {
                    "labels": {"name": "must-be-good", "service": "must-be-good-service"},
                    "limit": 5
                }
            },
            "tolerance": true,
        }
    ]
}
```

This above example will get the last 5 Objective Results for our `Must be good` SLO and determine if they were all okay or whether we've spent our [error budget](https://sre.google/workbook/error-budget-policy/#:~:text=Error%20budgets%20are%20the%20tool,with%20the%20pace%20of%20innovation.&text=The%20error%20budget%20forms%20a,has%20a%200.1%25%20error%20budget.)
they are allowed.


### As controls

You can use controls provided by `chaostoolkit-reliably` to track your experiments
withing your Reliably network. Each time you run an experiment, it will create:

* An entity for the experiment as a whole (If it doesn't already exist)
* An entity for the specific version of the experiment (If it doesn't already exist)
* An entity for the specific run of that experiment version
* Several entities for the events that take place in your experiment

You can also related the whole collection of entities to any other Reliably entities
already in your network.

A full example of using the controls is below:

```json
"controls": [
    {
        "name": "chaosreliably",
        "provider": {
            "type": "python",
            "module": "chaosreliably.controls.experiment",
            "arguments": {
                "commit_hash": "59f9f577e2d90719098f4d23d26329ce41f2d0bd",
                "source": "https://github.com/my-org/my-repo/exp.json",
                "user": "MyName",
                "experiment_related_to_labels": [
                    {
                        "name": "99.9% of our requests are in the 2xx class",
                        "service": "My amazing service"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
],
```

This will create entities that would appear similar to this:

### As Safeguards

Safeguards, provided by the
[Chaos Toolkit addons extension](https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit-addons)
gives you a nice way to interrupt an experiment as soon as error budgets have
been consumed. This is orthogonal to the steady-state hypothesis as it is a
mechanism to protect your system from being harmed too harshly by an experiment.

```json
"controls": [
    {
        "name": "safeguard",
        "provider": {
            "type": "python",
            "module": "chaosaddons.controls.safeguards",
            "arguments": {
                "probes": [
                    {
                        "name": "we-do-not-have-enough-error-budget-left-to-carry-on",
                        "type": "probe",
                        "frequency": 5,
                        "provider": {
                            "type": "python",
                            "module": "chaosreliably.slo.probes",
                            "func": "slo_is_met",
                            "arguments": {
                                "labels": {"name": "must-be-good", "service": "must-be-good-service"},
                                "limit": 5
                            }
                        },
                        "tolerance": true
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
]
```

As you can notice it is the same construct as for the steady-state, it's merely
used with a different purpose. Here these probes will be executed every 5s
during the experiment (this frequence is for demo purposes, you would usually only run it
once every minute or less).

## Contribute

From a code perspective, if you wish to contribute, you will need to run a
Python 3.6+ environment. Please, fork this project, write unit tests to cover
the proposed changes, implement the changes, ensure they meet the formatting
standards set out by `black`, `flake8`, `isort`, and `mypy`, add an entry into
`CHANGELOG.md`, and then raise a PR to the repository for review

Please refer to the [formatting](#formatting-and-linting) section for more
information on the formatting standards.

The Chaos Toolkit projects require all contributors must sign a
[Developer Certificate of Origin][dco] on each commit they would like to merge
into the master branch of the repository. Please, make sure you can abide by
the rules of the DCO before submitting a PR.

[dco]: https://github.com/probot/dco#how-it-works

### Develop

If you wish to develop on this project, make sure to install the development
dependencies. But first, [create a virtual environment][venv] and then install
those dependencies.

[venv]: http://chaostoolkit.org/reference/usage/install/#create-a-virtual-environment

```console
$ make install-dev
```

### Test

To run the tests for the project execute the following:

```console
$ make tests
```

### Formatting and Linting

We use a combination of [`black`][black], [`flake8`][flake8], [`isort`][isort],
and [`mypy`][mypy] to both lint and format this repositories code.

[black]: https://github.com/psf/black
[flake8]: https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8
[isort]: https://github.com/PyCQA/isort
[mypy]: https://github.com/python/mypy

Before raising a Pull Request, we recommend you run formatting against your
code with:

```console
$ make format
```

This will automatically format any code that doesn't adhere to the formatting
standards.

As some things are not picked up by the formatting, we also recommend you run:

```console
$ make lint
```

To ensure that any unused import statements/strings that are too long, etc.
are also picked up. It will also provide you with any errors `mypy` picks up.
