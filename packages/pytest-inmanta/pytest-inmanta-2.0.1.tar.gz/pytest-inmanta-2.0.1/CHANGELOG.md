# v 2.0.1 (2020-01-26)
Changes in this release:
- Fix bug where the `project` fixture doesn't reset the current working directory in the cleanup stage.

# v 2.0.0 (2022-01-24)
Changes in this release:
- Added support for testing v2 modules.
- Extended to be compatible with `inmanta-core>=6`
- Added support for custom `inmanta_reset_state` method to clean up stateful modules between compiles
- Ensure that projects are compiled using a separate venv.
- Fixed typing issue for `filter_args` in different method of the Project class.

## Breaking changes
- pytest-inmanta now keeps `inmanta_plugins` submodules alive across compiles. As a result, stateful modules must implement
    custom state cleanup logic as described in the README.
