*The Siren* flow is aimed at supporting the fabrication of the feature film *The Siren*.

### Dependencies

* `file_prefix` and `file_path` params have been defined in objects of both asset and shot branches, to ease the management of file prefixes and paths wherever files are needed.

### Added

## [0.4.0] - 2021-05-11

### Added

* Libreflow's SubprocessView inherited from `kabaret.subprocess_manager` is now available in the GUI's list of view. Beware access to this view depends on the Libreflow [1.6.0](https://pypi.org/project/libreflow/1.6.0/) release, which introduced the feature.

If a non empty blocking scene (either named `breakdown.blend` or `blocking.blend`) exists in the list, the user can select in the prompted dialog a revision to create a working copy from. Otherwise, the action will create an empty file without prompting a dialog.

### Changed

* Blocking scenes have been more explicitly renamed *blocking.blend*.

## [0.3.6] - 2021-04-20

### Added

* Tracked file dependencies can now be displayed and requested by means of a `GetDependencies` action.
  - Theoretical dependencies are collected from predefined dependency templates, wichi include the Kitsu casting of the element the file belongs to (only shot as of now).
  - Real dependencies are retrieved from the Blender Asset Tracer report of a given revision.

## [0.3.5] - 2021-04-16

* The user update at startup might crash libreflow if the user hasn't connected yet. Fixed with a shinny try/expect.
* Default values have been set in the settings to avoid issues while creating a new project.

## [0.2.1] - 2021-03-26
