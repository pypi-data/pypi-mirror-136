Python client for `MLflow <https://mlflow.org>`_ REST API.

**Features:**

- Unlike `MLflow Tracking client <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.tracking.html>`__
  all REST API methods are exposed to user.

- All class fields are validated with `pydantic <https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io>`_.

- Basic and Bearer auth is supported.

- All methods and classes are documented.

**Limitations:**

- There is no integration with ML frameworks and libraries.
  You should use official `MLflow client <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html>`__ instead.

- There is no integration with S3 or other artifact storage type.
  You should access it directly with `boto3 <https://boto3.amazonaws.com>`_ or other client.

- Only Python 3.7+ is supported. Python 3.6 and lower already reached end of life.
