Description: # bsync
        Sync files from your computer to Box.com using the Box API
        
        Think rsync for Box
        
        Right now, this only syncs your folder to Box and not Box to your folder
        
        ## Install
        
        `pip install bsync`
        
        ## Configuration
        
        You need to create a Box app with access to writing files/folders.
        The app must have JWT server side auth enabled.
        The JSON settings file with your keys will be required to run this.
        
        ## Usage
        
        
        ```
        $ bsync --help
        
        Usage: bsync [OPTIONS] SOURCE_FOLDER BOX_FOLDER_ID
        
          Syncs the contents of local folder to your Box account
        
          SOURCE_FOLDER is the path of an existing folder
        
          BOX_FOLDER_ID is the ID for the folder in Box where you want the files sent
        
        Options:
          -u, --box-user TEXT             User account name on Box.com. Defaults to

          --log-file FILE                 Log file
          -o, --output TEXT               File to write created items as CSV report
          --help                          Show this message and exit
