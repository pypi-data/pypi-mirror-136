# PredFlow
## A python library for predictive coding simulations based on tensorflow

## WORK IN PROGRESS

Use the package manager `pip` (or `pip3`) to install `predflow`. 

```bash
pip3 install predflow[x]
```

where `x` is either `cpu` if you only intend to run simulations on CPU or `gpu` if you inted to run simulations on GPU(s) (in that case you should also make sure that you can run [TensorFlow GPU support](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu)).
