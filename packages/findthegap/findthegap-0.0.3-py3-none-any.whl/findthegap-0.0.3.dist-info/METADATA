## FindTheGap

This package provides tools for geometric data analysis, targeted at finding gaps and valleys in data distribution. It provides a (twice-differentiable) density estimator (Quartic Kernel Density Estimator) relying on pytorch for auto-differentaition, and methods to estimate critical points in the density as well as various statistics to identify and trace `gaps' and valleys in the distribution. See https://github.com/contardog/findthegap for demo and usecase notebook in the folder 'examples'.

This package can be installed through pip (https://pypi.org/project/findthegap/):

```
pip install findthegap 
```
