# Introduction

Still working in progress.

Python wrapper for Kaldi's native I/O. The internal implementation
uses C++ code from [Kaldi](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi).
A Python wrapper with [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11)
is provided to read ark/scp files from Kaldi in Python.

**Note**: This project is self-contained and does not depend on `Kaldi`.
