- [ ] In configuration use type annotation for type verification. Implement Literal as options.
- [ ] In tests support multiple python versions
- [ ] Check if coverage from doctest included
- [ ] Update venv outside tests and use it in pyinstaller build
- [ ] Add tests to plot from predictit
- [ ] Transform starter to cookiecutter
- [ ] Create GIF of vs code task
- [ ] Better test coverage (doctest in functions + check if in coverage)
- [ ] Check if in pyinstaller better way than hidden imports (add to analysis to build only necessary files)
- [ ] Finish start vue in debug from python
