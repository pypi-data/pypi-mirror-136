        NMRforMD is a python script to calculate NMR relaxation times from molecular dynamics trajectory files. Used in combination with `MDAnalysis`_, it allows for the analysis of trajectory files from LAMMPS, GROMACS, or AMBER simulation package.
        
        Information
        -----------
        
        NMRforMD is in development and likely to return errors. Please raise an issue here if you find one.

        .. inclusion-readme-installation-start
        
        Using pip, type in a terminal:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
        	pip install nmrformd
        
        Or, clone this repository on your computer and use pip from the main directory:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
        	git clone git@github.com:simongravelle/nmrformd.git
        	
        	cd nmrformd/
        
        	pip install .

        Known issues
        ------------
        
        - for very large trajectory file, the code requires a lot of memory
        - currently only residue are accepted to differentiate atoms from the same molecule/structure/residue
        - the code has mostly be tested with GROMACS trajectory file
