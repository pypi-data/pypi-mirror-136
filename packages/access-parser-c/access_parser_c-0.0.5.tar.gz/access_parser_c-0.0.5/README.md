# AccessDB Parser (Pure Python)
Microsoft Access (.mdb / .accdb) database files parser. The parsing logic is fully written in python and works without any external binary dependencies.

# Installing
Use pip: `pip install git+https://github.com/McSash/access_parser_c`

Or install manually:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/McSash/access_parser_c.git
cd access_parser_c
python3 setup.py install
```

# Usage Example
```python
from access_parser_c import AccessParser

# .mdb or .accdb file
db = AccessParser("/path/to/mdb/file.mdb")

# Print DB tables
print(db.catalog)

# Tables are stored as defaultdict(list) -- table[column][row_index]
table = db.parse_table("table_name")

# Pretty print all tables
db.print_database()

```

# Another Usage Example

```python
from access_parser import AccessParser
from azure.storage.blob import ContainerClient

# Download access file from azure blob storage
BlobContainerClient = ContainerClient.from_connection_string("<StorageConnectionString>", container_name="<ContainerName>")
access_object = BlobContainerClient.download_blob("<PathToFile>").readall()

# Bytes object of .mdb or .accdb file
db = AccessParser(access_object)

# Print DB tables
print(db.catalog)

# Tables are stored as defaultdict(list) -- table[column][row_index]
table = db.parse_table("table_name")

# Pretty print all tables
db.print_database()

```

### Known Issues
* OLE fields are currently not supported
* Only a subset of memo fields are parsed

This library was tested on a limited subset of database files. Due to the differences between database versions and the complexity of the parsing we expect to find more parsing edge-cases.

To help us resolve issues faster please provide as much data as you can when opening an issue - DB file if possible and full trace including log messages.
