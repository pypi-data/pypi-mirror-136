# Routines

This package contains helper methods to perform certain routine activities in the act of image processing with pyautogui

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install routines.

```bash
pip install pyroutines
```

## Usage

```python
import pyroutines as pyrout


# returns 'boolean'
pyrout.move_to_image(path_of_images, auto_click=True)
"""
Note that the auto_click parameter is optional
and setting it to True, when locating the image, a click will automatically be executed.
The necessary parameter "list of images" must contain at
least 1 item in the source directory so that it is possible to read the 
image and search for it elsewhere
"""


# returns 'None'
pyrout.save_logs(message, method_name, error=False)
"""
Auxiliary method to save logs and print the information on the console.
The 'message' parameter refers to the message that will be displayed
in the log file and in the console, the method_name parameter serves
 to identify the name of the routine where the error occurred and the 
optional 'error' parameter serves to indicate the type of message to be displayed
"""
