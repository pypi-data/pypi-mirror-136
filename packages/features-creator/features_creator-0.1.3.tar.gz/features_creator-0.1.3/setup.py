For example payment_week_1, payment_week_2, ...\nFor such datasets, commonly engineered features include, among others, the percentage change across time periods, the average across time periods, and the standard deviation across time periods.\n\nThis package defines the following four functions:\n\n- `get_matching_column_names`: Returns a subset of the columns whose names match the pattern. This is a prerequisite for the feature engineering\n- `calculate_average`: Returns the average value across matching columns for each row.\n- `calculate_standard_deviation`: Returns the stadard deviation across matching columns for each row.\n- `calculate_percentage_change`: Returns the percent change across consecutive time periods for each row.\n\n### How does this package fit into the existing ecosystem?\n\nThere are many Python libraries available that facilitate feature engineering,\nthe two most common ones are [Featuretools](https://www.featuretools.com/) and [Feature-engine](https://feature-engine.readthedocs.io/en/1.2.x/).\n`Featuretools` has much more functionality than `features_creator`, but is more heavyweight and comes with a steeper learning curve.\nIt also requires quite a lot of data massaging to get it into the correct format before features can be engineered.\n`Feature-engine` also has a wide variety of functionality, but it is not tailored to temporal data.\n`Feature-engine` is more focused on data imputation, discretization, encoding, and outlier removal.\n\nFor datasets that have columns that follow the pattern `quantity_1`, `quantity_2`, ... `features_creator` is the simplest package for engineering features.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n$ pip install git+https://github.com/UBC-MDS/features_creator\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n- TODO\n\n## Contributing\n\nInterested in contributing?
